176
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
Speaker 0: Refusing  to  take  a  knee?

177
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,860
Speaker 0: Black  lives  matter.

178
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:54,660
Speaker 0: Who  are  you?

179
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,820

Speaker 0: Your  life  matters.

185
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,660
Speaker 0: And  you  still  refuse  to  take  a  knee.

186
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,620
Speaker 0: We're  all  down  here.

Speaker 0: We're  gonna  play  some  old  football  games  over  a  kneel,  but  all  of  a  sudden  it's  okay,  right?

191
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:41,960
Speaker 0: The  fuck?

Speaker 0: Months.

199
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:49,900
Speaker 0: Nothing.

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,860
Speaker 0: They  kneeled  on  my  neck.

201
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,120
Speaker 0: Not  my  neck,  but  you  know.

202
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,460
Speaker 0: They'll  kneel  on  your  neck,  but  you  won't  kneel  for  tolerance.

203
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,660
Speaker 0: For  real.

204
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,820
Speaker 0: They'll  kneel  on  your  neck,  but  they  won't  kneel  for  tolerance.

205
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,920
Speaker 0: Kneel  on  our  neck,  but  no  kneel  for  tolerance?

206
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,260
Speaker 0: They'll  kneel  on  our  neck,  but  you  won't  kneel  for  tolerance.

207
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,880
Speaker 0: It  mean  nothing.

Speaker 0: You  gonna  kneel  again?

213
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,910

Speaker 0: Do  y 'all  care  about  what's  going  on  with  him?

219
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,150
Speaker 0: Watch  his  body  language.

Speaker 0: Obviously  not.

224
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,930
Speaker 0: Black  police  showing  up  with  a  white  cop.

225
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,650
Speaker 0: It's  a  head  nod,  a  yes  or  no.

226
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,610
Speaker 0: Black  police  showing  up  with  a  white  cop.

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,210
Speaker 0: I  can't  even  see  your  badge.

285
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,370
Speaker 0: So,  that's  good.

286
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,170
Speaker 0: But  you.

287
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,690

Speaker 0: But  if  they  do  that  shit,  don't  hit  us.

297
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,370
Speaker 0: Don't  be  a  big  mistake.
