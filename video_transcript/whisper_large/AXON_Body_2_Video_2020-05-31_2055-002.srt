Speaker 0: I got the right to be here just like you.

171
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,373
Speaker 0: You understand where we're coming from?

172
00:26:01,462 --> 00:26:02,459
Speaker 0: You should be on this side.

173
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:05,000
Speaker 0: We just want to know if you know where we're coming from.

174
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,478
Speaker 0: You get the message of the protest?

175
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,779
Speaker 0: So why do we got to move?

176
00:26:08,921 --> 00:26:10,800
Speaker 0: We got people coming from behind us too now.

177
00:26:13,142 --> 00:26:15,300
Speaker 0: Like black people get attacked in the street and get killed.

178
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,776
Speaker 0: But why do we got to move?

179
00:26:18,301 --> 00:26:19,519
Speaker 0: We have the right to be here.

180
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,198
Speaker 0: Because we have the currency back there.

181
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:21,720
Speaker 0: We got to move.

182
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:30,725
Speaker 0: We got to move.

183
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,704
Speaker 0: We got to move.

184
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,540
Speaker 0: We got to move.

185
00:26:48,182 --> 00:26:48,906
Speaker 0: We got to move.

186
00:26:51,665 --> 00:26:52,338
Speaker 0: We got to move.

187
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,040
Speaker 0: We don't want to die in the streets.

188
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,260
Speaker 0: That's all we just said.

189
00:26:58,381 --> 00:26:59,400
Speaker 0: We don't want to die in the streets.

190
00:27:00,521 --> 00:27:02,060
Speaker 0: I don't understand why you here.

191
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,698
Speaker 0: We can't get in.

192
00:27:02,942 --> 00:27:03,380
Speaker 0: We got to get in.

193
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:05,260
Speaker 0: Is it hot for you to see shit?

194
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,520
Speaker 0: Like why do they got to do this shit?

195
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:07,337
Speaker 0: You guys stole it.

196
00:27:09,103 --> 00:27:09,980
Speaker 0: You guys stole it.

197
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:14,060
Speaker 0: What are you talking about you guys?

198
00:27:15,121 --> 00:27:15,331
Speaker 0: You guys.

199
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:16,900
Speaker 0: You guys.

200
00:27:18,461 --> 00:27:19,379
Speaker 0: I mean this is fucking useless.

201
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,020
Speaker 0: We got all these people coming behind us now.

202
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:22,100
Speaker 0: I mean what the fuck?

Speaker 0: You guys.

204
00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:24,260
Speaker 0: You guys.

205
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:24,486
Speaker 0: You suckers.

206
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,279
Speaker 0: Look at all these fucking people coming out from behind us.

207
00:27:30,502 --> 00:27:31,058
Speaker 0: This is fucking useless.

208
00:27:31,402 --> 00:27:32,300
Speaker 0: We're just trying to keep up with them.

209
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,340
Speaker 0: But they're going to keep coming this way until we get the pop up there.

210
00:27:35,543 --> 00:27:36,679
Speaker 0: I'm just going to walk kind of watch.

211
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,338
Speaker 0: All the way.

212
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:38,595
Speaker 0: Watch your back.

213
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,500
Speaker 0: We'll come behind you.

214
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:39,700
Speaker 0: Yeah.

215
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,520
Speaker 0: We got to watch our back a little bit here.

216
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:51,230
Speaker 0: Go to Temple Street.

217
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:51,530
Speaker 0: It's good.

218
00:27:57,544 --> 00:27:57,611
Speaker 0: Huh?

219
00:28:28,314 --> 00:28:29,270
Speaker 0: Hey guys, let's get over here.

220
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:30,809
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of people coming in from behind us.

221
00:28:46,581 --> 00:28:46,751
Speaker 0: Crap.

00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:54,560
Speaker 0: They might still be back on Winter Street.

225
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,580
Speaker 0: Where's James?

226
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,316
Speaker 0: All right.

227
00:29:55,372 --> 00:29:57,229
Speaker 0: We're sitting ducks out in the middle of the fucking street like this.

228
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,378
Speaker 0: You know what?

229
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,280
Speaker 0: Go back that way.

230
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,710
Speaker 0: I got to get this car out of here.

231
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:13,790
Speaker 0: I got to get this car out of here.

232
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:14,748
Speaker 0: He's got a baby in the car.

239
00:33:36,354 --> 00:33:36,610
Speaker 0: Deputy.

240
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:39,190
Speaker 0: He's got a baby in the car.

241
00:33:39,391 --> 00:33:40,110
Speaker 0: We got to get him out.

242
00:33:40,212 --> 00:33:40,929
Speaker 0: He's got a baby in the car.

243
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:41,370
Speaker 0: He's coughing.

244
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:42,610
Speaker 0: He's fucking idiot.

245
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,169
Speaker 0: Go ahead.

246
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,589
Speaker 0: Just keep going nice and slow.

247
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:45,966
Speaker 0: All right.

248
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:02,860
Speaker 0: I got hit by a rock.

249
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:47,489
Speaker 0: Get him out of here.

250
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,569
Speaker 0: He's got a baby in the car.

251
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:04,299
Speaker 0: Put your lights on.

252
00:35:04,481 --> 00:35:05,200
Speaker 0: Try to get him out of here.

253
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,939
Speaker 0: He's got a kid in the car.

254
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,640
Speaker 0: I'm trying to fuck him.

255
00:35:07,266 --> 00:35:07,395
Speaker 0: Listen.

256
00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:08,839
Speaker 0: You stay right behind her.

257
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,240
Speaker 0: She's going to try to get you out of here.

258
00:35:10,322 --> 00:35:10,540
Speaker 0: All right?

259

00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,120
Speaker 0: Where the fuck she went?

261
00:36:43,255 --> 00:36:43,829
Speaker 0: They stayed back.

262
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,229
Speaker 0: Tell them to fucking stay behind her.

263
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:46,830
Speaker 0: Do what you can, Annie.

264
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:47,243
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

265
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:48,690
Speaker 0: What's up?

266
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:49,690
Speaker 0: Thank you.

267
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,369
Speaker 0: You should watch yourself.

268
00:36:50,735 --> 00:36:51,006
Speaker 0: Thank you.

269
00:36:51,532 --> 00:36:52,389
Speaker 0: You shoot me in the face.

270
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:53,350
Speaker 0: You can't go one on one.

271
00:36:54,455 --> 00:36:55,150
Speaker 0: Aaron, get out of here.

272
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:56,310
Speaker 0: You're going to fucking scare me.

273
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:56,990
Speaker 0: There you go.

274
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:57,619
Speaker 0: One on one.

00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:24,170
Speaker 0: Oh, he's hit by a bottle.

279
00:37:24,312 --> 00:37:24,490
Speaker 0: He's hit.

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,700
Speaker 0: They're coming from behind us, too, now.

286
00:45:43,492 --> 00:45:44,949
Speaker 0: We're sitting ducks over here like this.

287
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:45,949
Speaker 0: This is fucking nuts.

288
00:45:47,192 --> 00:45:55,470
Speaker 0: We're sitting ducks like this in the fucking middle.

289
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:57,790
Speaker 0: We need to get the fuck out of here.

290
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,071
Speaker 0: What are we doing, Matt?

291
00:46:40,623 --> 00:46:41,779
Speaker 0: We're fucking sitting ducks like this.

292
00:46:42,164 --> 00:46:42,452
Speaker 0: Behind us.

293
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,215
Speaker 0: In front of us.

294
00:50:02,322 --> 00:50:02,918
Speaker 0: Be advised.

295
00:50:13,732 --> 00:51:05,778
Speaker 0: If you do not disperse... More fucking objects.

296
00:54:53,972 --> 00:54:54,568
Speaker 0: Be advised.

297
00:55:57,652 --> 00:56:00,189
Speaker 0: You are hereby ordered by the state police to disperse.

298
00:56:01,237 --> 00:56:02,389
Speaker 0: We will deploy the gas.

299
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:46,800
Speaker 0: Alright, yep.

300
01:02:57,264 --> 01:02:57,757
Speaker 0: What's that?

301
01:02:58,225 --> 01:02:59,299
Speaker 0: We're going to deploy your team.

302
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,280
Speaker 0: We're going to move forward.

303
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,400
Speaker 0: We're going to disperse.

304
01:03:01,802 --> 01:03:01,980
Speaker 0: Alright?

305
01:03:03,184 --> 01:03:03,614
Speaker 0: Stay tight.

306
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:05,939
Speaker 0: Why are you causing a traffic jam?

307
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:07,138
Speaker 0: You're in the middle of an intersection.

308
01:03:07,441 --> 01:03:07,937
Speaker 0: What are you doing?

309
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:21,459
Speaker 0: Hold the line.

310
01:03:21,561 --> 01:03:21,958
Speaker 0: Hold the line.

311
01:03:23,389 --> 01:03:23,495
Speaker 0: Go.

312
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:23,984
Speaker 0: Go.

313
01:03:24,806 --> 01:03:25,014
Speaker 0: Get off.

314
01:03:25,342 --> 01:03:25,838
Speaker 0: Get off and go.

315
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:27,078
Speaker 0: Go.

316
01:05:19,909 --> 01:05:20,699
Speaker 0: They were leaving.

317
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,259
Speaker 0: That's why they're out of the park.

318
01:05:23,483 --> 01:05:25,859
Speaker 0: Now you're moving them back to the park?

319
01:05:26,785 --> 01:05:27,779
Speaker 0: They're fucking kids.

320
01:05:28,344 --> 01:05:30,459
Speaker 0: The neighborhoods gave them love all day long.

321
01:05:30,803 --> 01:05:31,657
Speaker 0: You know who didn't?

322
01:05:39,164 --> 01:05:40,499
Speaker 0: These are fucking kids, man.

323
01:05:41,607 --> 01:05:42,218
Speaker 0: Look at them.

324
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:54,050
Speaker 0: Show them where you are.

325
01:05:54,212 --> 01:05:54,869
Speaker 0: They were leaving.

326
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:56,610
Speaker 0: That's why they're out of the park.

327
01:05:56,711 --> 01:05:57,106
Speaker 0: Pause that.

328
01:06:03,318 --> 01:06:03,830
Speaker 0: Be advised.

329
01:06:06,221 --> 01:06:07,178
Speaker 0: We're standing here.

330
01:06:11,443 --> 01:06:11,896
Speaker 0: Be advised.

331
01:11:08,903 --> 01:11:09,697
Speaker 0: I can't breathe.

332
01:11:56,222 --> 01:11:56,617
Speaker 0: Idiots.

333
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:57,680
Speaker 0: I can't breathe.

334
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:28,758
Speaker 0: Take some of these.

335
01:13:28,901 --> 01:13:29,937
Speaker 0: Let me go home.

336
01:13:30,441 --> 01:13:31,117
Speaker 0: Take a knee.

337
01:13:31,602 --> 01:13:32,358
Speaker 0: Take a knee.

338
01:13:32,861 --> 01:13:33,657
Speaker 0: Take a knee.

339
01:13:34,162 --> 01:13:34,958
Speaker 0: Take a knee.

340
01:13:35,443 --> 01:13:36,279
Speaker 0: Take a knee.

341
01:13:38,002 --> 01:13:38,860
