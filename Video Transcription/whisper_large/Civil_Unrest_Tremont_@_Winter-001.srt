1
00:14:36,220 --> 00:00:44,199
Speaker 0: Mike, you've got to lock this thing up, too.

2
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:01,864
Speaker 0: Spray.

3
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:04,370
Speaker 0: You got your helmet?

4
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,000
Speaker 0: Mike, let's go.

5
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:14,700
Speaker 0: They're outside.

6
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,749
Speaker 0: The sergeant was trying to form a line going that way.

7
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,147
Speaker 0: Going across.

8
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:33,790
Speaker 0: Watch that way.

9
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,970
Speaker 0: You're going to have to wait a few minutes, buddy.

10
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:40,547
Speaker 0: Oh, I did.

11
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,910
Speaker 0: You're going to have to wait a few minutes, buddy.

12
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,320
Speaker 0: He's getting laid in.

13
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:43,029
Speaker 0: Who?

14
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,581
Speaker 0: Can we go spray the car?

15
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:26,600
Speaker 0: No, you've got to cut through them.

16
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,580
Speaker 0: Give them a couple of minutes.

17
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:29,660
Speaker 0: Cross the street and go that way, all right?

18
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:31,158
Speaker 0: Thank you, guys.

19
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:32,438
Speaker 0: Thank you.

20
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,273
Speaker 0: Be careful.

21
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,554
Speaker 0: What's up?

22
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,629
Speaker 0: When everything's going down down there, I need my girl to know which way she went.

23
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, you've got to go that way, ladies.

24
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:49,687
Speaker 0: She needs to get out of the mercy line.

25
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,100
Speaker 0: No one knows where she is right now.

26
00:11:54,503 --> 00:11:55,580
Speaker 0: Fucking assholes.

27
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:56,998
Speaker 0: All of you.

28
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:58,739
Speaker 0: I fucking hate y'all.

29
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:02,159
Speaker 0: I've been here.

30
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:03,260
Speaker 0: Keep going that way.

31
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:04,340
Speaker 0: Keep going that way, ma'am.

32
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:06,137
Speaker 0: You don't deserve to be here.

33
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:06,800
Speaker 0: Keep going that way.

34
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,819
Speaker 0: You don't deserve to be here.

35
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,740
Speaker 0: Ma'am, keep going that way.

36
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:10,799
Speaker 0: You don't deserve any of those badges.

37
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,777
Speaker 0: Stop it.

38
00:12:12,241 --> 00:12:13,359
Speaker 0: You don't deserve that badge.

39
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:14,120
Speaker 0: All right, all right.

40
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:15,899
Speaker 0: You don't deserve your badge.

41
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,460
Speaker 0: Ma'am, keep going.

42
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:17,520
Speaker 0: And you don't deserve your badge.

43
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:18,999
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

44
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:21,180
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

45
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,751
Speaker 0: Thank you.

46
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:35,846
Speaker 0: No.

47
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,347
Speaker 0: Listen to us.

48
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:55,075
Speaker 0: I don't need it.

49
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:19,070
Speaker 0: I can't hear you, ma'am.

50
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,573
Speaker 0: I think that's going to be shut down.

51
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,039
Speaker 0: You might have to go to Haymarket or State Street.

52
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,220
Speaker 0: South Station?

53
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:31,292
Speaker 0: We are going to Ashmont.

54
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:34,359
Speaker 0: So you've got to take the red line.

55
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:35,859
Speaker 0: But, ma'am, I'm asking you.

56
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,780
Speaker 0: If they say we have to get on that car.

57
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,657
Speaker 0: We go South Station.

58
00:14:43,662 --> 00:14:44,560
Speaker 0: You want to go South Station?

59
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:44,853
Speaker 0: Yeah.

60
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,419
Speaker 0: Why don't you head down this way, ma'am.

61
00:14:47,984 --> 00:14:48,539
Speaker 0: Where's your friend?

62
00:14:49,426 --> 00:14:49,858
Speaker 0: My nephew.

63
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,368
Speaker 0: Come on.

64
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:52,078
Speaker 0: Thank you.

65
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:53,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, be careful.

66
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,380
Speaker 0: Be careful going through there.

67
00:14:58,347 --> 00:14:58,700
Speaker 0: Excuse me.

68
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,080
Speaker 0: What's up, buddy?

69
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:00,180
Speaker 0: Sorry if I can get through here.

70
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,897
Speaker 0: My apartment's closed.

71
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,299
Speaker 0: They've got to shut down for now.

72
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,799
Speaker 0: Give them a couple of minutes.

73
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,340
Speaker 0: We're hoping to open this up.

74
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:08,979
Speaker 0: It's a whole district to start with.

75
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,180
Speaker 0: No one's going through.

76
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:11,136
Speaker 0: You're here.

77
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,037
Speaker 0: You can take anybody who comes through.

78
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:25,969
Speaker 0: That's on me.

79
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,590
Speaker 0: I thought she was by herself.

80
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,910
Speaker 0: Just go straight that way?

81
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,252
Speaker 0: Go that way because everybody's walking this way.

82
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:05,488
Speaker 0: Yes, sir.

83
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,089
Speaker 0: Got you.

84
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:08,147
Speaker 0: Next right is my right.

85
00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:25,180
Speaker 0: You can't stay in the heat.

86
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:26,280
Speaker 0: You shouldn't want to come down here.

87
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,889
Speaker 0: Education, welfare, too.

88
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:15,329
Speaker 0: Y'all press us for education.

89
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:16,208
Speaker 0: Not me, but you.

90
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:17,610
Speaker 0: I know you're not a white man.

91
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:18,446
Speaker 0: I can't really tell you.

92
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:19,349
Speaker 0: You look Hispanic.

93
00:22:20,854 --> 00:22:21,728
Speaker 0: You can't even tell me.

94
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:30,639
Speaker 0: Y'all feel any sympathy for this?

95
00:22:36,484 --> 00:22:37,800
Speaker 0: I mean to leave me out there bad.

96
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,900
Speaker 0: This is one of them things about an hour right now.

97
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,090
Speaker 0: Biggest question I always have for you guys.

98
00:22:52,874 --> 00:22:55,549
Speaker 0: Why the fuck does it take about four or five properties?

99
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:58,989
Speaker 0: I swear to God.

100
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:06,509
Speaker 0: People up on the scaffolding.

101
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,926
Speaker 0: And it really will only take these big ass houses.

102
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,290
Speaker 0: They will only take them.

103
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:14,709
Speaker 0: Y'all really, y'all.

104
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:20,056
Speaker 0: It is what it is.

105
00:23:23,763 --> 00:23:25,239
Speaker 0: Just in general with all this shit.

106
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,300
Speaker 0: Not tonight.

107
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:28,377
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah.

108
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,920
Speaker 0: It's nice when I fucking win stuff.

109
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:32,943
Speaker 0: I wish I had a jacket.

110
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,238
Speaker 0: What's that?

111
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:38,419
Speaker 0: I wish I had a jacket.

112
00:23:39,323 --> 00:23:40,160
Speaker 0: That's why I walk around.

113
00:23:40,705 --> 00:23:41,298
Speaker 0: It's not too much.

114
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:43,420
Speaker 0: It's not personally y'all.

115
00:23:45,164 --> 00:23:46,659
Speaker 0: But y'all love the uniform.

116
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,519
Speaker 0: That's why I run.

117
00:23:48,705 --> 00:23:49,174
Speaker 0: We could go around.

118
00:23:49,944 --> 00:23:50,219
Speaker 0: I don't know.

119
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,019
Speaker 0: We're trying to find a street.

120
00:23:51,602 --> 00:23:52,819
Speaker 0: I don't know where A. Walk that way, ladies.

121
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,580
Speaker 0: If you want to go around, we got to walk that way.

122
00:23:54,904 --> 00:23:55,920
Speaker 0: There's A. Winter Street.

123
00:23:56,205 --> 00:23:56,680
Speaker 0: What is it there?

124
00:23:57,084 --> 00:23:57,960
Speaker 0: A. Winter Street.

125
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,900
Speaker 0: That's where she is.

126
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:00,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's going to have to come up here.

127
00:24:01,082 --> 00:24:02,020
Speaker 0: I don't know where that is.

128
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:04,719
Speaker 0: You won't be able to go down.

129
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,938
Speaker 0: You might have to walk around.

130
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:10,429
Speaker 0: Yeah.

131
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,705
Speaker 0: You know what I'm saying?

132
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,896
Speaker 0: You know what I'm saying?

133
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:32,798
Speaker 0: Same uniform.

134
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:33,485
Speaker 0: Same name.

135
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:40,825
Speaker 0: Same shirt.

136
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,570
Speaker 0: But like I said, I'm not blaming y'all.

137
00:24:45,972 --> 00:24:47,267
Speaker 0: I'm just asking y'all to get somewhere.

138
00:24:49,674 --> 00:24:50,829
Speaker 0: I ain't here to start no shit.

139
00:24:50,971 --> 00:24:51,569
Speaker 0: Let me ask you a question.

140
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,570
Speaker 0: Like I told you, I used to run when I was in the military.

141
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,126
Speaker 0: I used to run.

142
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:55,910
Speaker 0: Fear is good.

143
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:45,730
Speaker 0: Fear is healthy.

144
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:46,828
Speaker 0: Fear is good.

145
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,381
Speaker 0: It's an emotion.

146
00:25:48,593 --> 00:25:49,869
Speaker 0: And that fucking guy, he didn't care.

147
00:25:50,254 --> 00:25:50,767
Speaker 0: He didn't care.

148
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,889
Speaker 0: How many people are there going to come up to you?

149
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:53,929
Speaker 0: From here?

150
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:54,866
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

151
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,970
Speaker 0: I don't know where they are.

152
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,264
Speaker 0: I don't want to sleep in anybody's eyes.

153
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,530
Speaker 0: I don't know why I can't sleep.

154
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,567
Speaker 0: I don't know why I can't sleep.

155
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:04,424
Speaker 0: I don't know why I can't sleep.

156
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,746
Speaker 0: I don't know why I can't sleep.

157
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,307
Speaker 0: I don't know why I can't sleep.

158
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,490
Speaker 0: I don't know why I can't sleep.

159
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,809
Speaker 0: I don't know why I can't sleep.

160
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:14,388
Speaker 0: It's an emotion.

161
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:16,829
Speaker 0: Fear is good.

162
00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:19,025
Speaker 0: It's good.

163
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:21,183
Speaker 0: It's good.

164
00:26:28,681 --> 00:26:29,460
Speaker 0: It's good.

165
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:31,054
Speaker 0: It's good.

166
00:26:32,163 --> 00:26:32,497
Speaker 0: It's good.

167
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:33,500
Speaker 0: It's good.

168
00:26:33,703 --> 00:26:33,914
Speaker 0: It's good.

169
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:34,540
Speaker 0: It's good.

170
00:26:34,966 --> 00:26:35,378
Speaker 0: It's good.

171
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:36,100

00:43:56,507 --> 00:43:56,759
Speaker 0: All right.

306
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,408
Speaker 0: This is our money.

307
00:43:58,428 --> 00:43:59,700
Speaker 0: we're going to spend on protests, huh?

308
00:44:00,363 --> 00:44:03,097
Speaker 0: Who wants to stop killing people?

309
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,260
Speaker 0: That would work.

310
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,874
Speaker 0: They didn't kill the people.

311
00:44:07,823 --> 00:44:09,178
Speaker 0: Yes, they did.

312
00:44:10,462 --> 00:44:11,619
Speaker 0: Because they all supported you.

313
00:44:12,805 --> 00:44:13,360
Speaker 0: That's the thing.

314
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,320
Speaker 0: They support the system.

315
00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:17,319
Speaker 0: They are the system.

316
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,499
Speaker 0: They're by the system.

317
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,975
Speaker 0: They could have been protesting, but they're here standing up for the system.

318
00:44:27,002 --> 00:44:27,955
Speaker 0: It is their problem.

319
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:29,984
Speaker 0: Yes.

320
00:44:31,565 --> 00:44:31,800
Speaker 0: They're not.

321
00:44:44,896 --> 00:44:49,030
Speaker 0: We don't have... We're tired of not being fair, so now we're fighting for justice.

322
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:53,135
Speaker 0: I got shoes on.

323
00:44:56,351 --> 00:44:56,688
Speaker 0: Adidas.

324
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:57,929
Speaker 0: I don't mean to be like that.

325
00:45:06,154 --> 00:45:06,489
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

326
00:45:07,011 --> 00:45:07,887
Speaker 0: I'm not shutting you up at all.

327
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:09,629
Speaker 0: I'm not shutting you up at all.

328
00:45:10,934 --> 00:45:13,738
Speaker 0: Like I said, you know, I don't want them to have that negative indication about us.

329
00:45:14,773 --> 00:45:19,329
Speaker 0: We're all here for peace, but we've got to improve it.

330
00:45:19,431 --> 00:45:19,729
Speaker 0: Thank you.

331
00:45:52,121 --> 00:45:53,760
Speaker 0: Are all the streets closed?

332
00:45:54,563 --> 00:45:54,975
Speaker 0: One this way?

333
00:45:56,361 --> 00:45:57,959
Speaker 0: I have to walk to South Station.

334
00:45:58,704 --> 00:46:03,495
Speaker 0: So go all the way down here, as far as you can, take a left onto Essex.

335
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:04,646
Speaker 0: Down here.

336
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:05,494
Speaker 0: Thank you.

337
00:46:08,322 --> 00:46:09,500
Speaker 0: Essex is crazy.

338
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,258
Speaker 0: Essex and Wash.

339
00:46:31,616 --> 00:46:32,042
Speaker 0: He got it.

340
00:46:32,082 --> 00:46:32,670
Speaker 0: He got maced.

341
00:46:33,371 --> 00:46:34,689
Speaker 0: He's getting rinsed out with milk.

342
00:46:40,491 --> 00:46:43,445
Speaker 0: They were pouring milk in his eyes.

343
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:45,210
Speaker 0: Can I get that?

344
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:46,945
Speaker 0: Can I get that?

345
00:47:02,683 --> 00:47:03,677
Speaker 0: There's way too many of us here.

346
00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:04,799
Speaker 0: They call for help.

347
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,880
Speaker 0: We've got to go to the other place.

348
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,199
Speaker 0: They've got to pull some of us off.

349
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,148
Speaker 0: I'm sick of that man's cold blood.

350
00:47:28,854 --> 00:47:29,689
Speaker 0: I'm tired of it.

351
00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:32,548
Speaker 0: I'm tired of it.

352
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:35,010
Speaker 0: They don't have free minds.

353
00:47:35,631 --> 00:47:36,790
Speaker 0: They're slaves to the system.

354
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:38,670
Speaker 0: You guys are a part of the machine.

355
00:47:39,553 --> 00:47:40,470
Speaker 0: The system is built.

356
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:41,990
Speaker 0: They're killing the systematic.

357
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:44,990
Speaker 0: They're killing the systematic.

358
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:46,928
Speaker 0: The shit is systematic.

359
00:47:50,253 --> 00:47:51,664
Speaker 0: We need a better system.

360
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:53,995
Speaker 0: We need a better system.

361
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,467
Speaker 0: They killed him.

362
00:47:59,932 --> 00:48:00,668
Speaker 0: He's fucking dead.

363
00:48:01,271 --> 00:48:02,848
Speaker 0: Look what you fucking did.

364
00:48:08,232 --> 00:48:10,349
Speaker 0: Your eyes don't fucking look like his.

365
00:48:10,992 --> 00:48:12,047
Speaker 0: Your eyes don't look like his.

366
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:13,969
Speaker 0: Look what you fucking did.

367
00:48:17,211 --> 00:48:18,910
Speaker 0: They killed him in cold blood.

368
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,150
Speaker 0: That could have been me.

369
00:48:21,251 --> 00:48:22,049
Speaker 0: That could have been you.

370
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,109
Speaker 0: That could have been you.

371
00:48:25,253 --> 00:48:25,658
Speaker 0: Cold blood.

372
00:48:30,271 --> 00:48:31,580
Speaker 0: That's in front of the car.

373
00:48:54,991 --> 00:49:01,775
Speaker 0: Traffic control.

374
00:49:16,631 --> 00:49:17,158
Speaker 0: You're a bitch.

375
00:49:17,807 --> 00:49:18,359
Speaker 0: You're a bitch.

376
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:19,336
Speaker 0: You're a bitch.

377
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:20,700
Speaker 0: You're a bitch.

378
00:49:23,091 --> 00:49:23,799
Speaker 0: And you're a bitch.

379
00:49:25,702 --> 00:49:27,210
Speaker 0: We finally got body care.

380
00:49:30,902 --> 00:49:31,297
Speaker 0: It's good.

381
00:49:33,864 --> 00:49:35,310
Speaker 0: We need a better system.

382
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:47,140
Speaker 0: The power is with the people.

383
00:49:47,761 --> 00:49:48,739
Speaker 0: Not with the police.

384
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,359
Speaker 0: The power is with the people, not with the police.

385
00:49:54,362 --> 00:49:56,900
Speaker 0: The power is with the people, not with the police.

386
00:50:01,027 --> 00:50:02,359
Speaker 0: Now they told us to bring the gas masks.

387
00:50:04,903 --> 00:50:06,980
Speaker 0: I see the human being inside all of you guys.

388
00:50:11,131 --> 00:50:12,449
Speaker 0: And I know you all saw the video.

389
00:50:14,755 --> 00:50:16,009
Speaker 0: I know you saw the video, sir.

390
00:50:17,272 --> 00:50:18,126
Speaker 0: That shit was cold.

391
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:19,949
Speaker 0: That shit was cold.

392
00:50:26,553 --> 00:50:27,749
Speaker 0: People are tired of this shit.

393
00:50:28,872 --> 00:50:29,648
Speaker 0: We need fairness.

394
00:50:31,615 --> 00:50:32,629
Speaker 0: They all need to be arrested.

395
00:50:33,051 --> 00:50:34,008
Speaker 0: All of them need to be arrested.

396
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:37,189
Speaker 0: And they all need to be tried.

397
00:50:38,052 --> 00:50:39,088
Speaker 0: For killing innocent men.

398
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:42,210
Speaker 0: In custody, handcuffs.

399
00:50:42,513 --> 00:50:43,469
Speaker 0: What kind of shit is that?

400
00:50:47,634 --> 00:50:48,947
Speaker 0: I know y'all can all relate as humans.

401
00:50:50,554 --> 00:50:52,129
Speaker 0: Not with the fucking badge.

402
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:53,910
Speaker 0: They killed that man.

403
00:50:56,693 --> 00:50:57,268
Speaker 0: Cold blood.

404
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,060
Speaker 0: Shit is systematic.

405
00:51:08,046 --> 00:51:09,079
Speaker 0: Shit is systematic.

406
00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:13,080
Speaker 0: Shit is systematic.

407
00:51:14,626 --> 00:51:15,518
Speaker 0: We need a better system.

408
00:51:17,446 --> 00:51:18,680
Speaker 0: It's not just George Floyd.

409
00:51:19,066 --> 00:51:19,540
Speaker 0: It's too many.

410
00:51:20,502 --> 00:51:21,979
Speaker 0: Too many in too many states.

411
00:51:22,402 --> 00:51:23,097
Speaker 0: Too many departments.

412
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:26,078
Speaker 0: What kind of training are they giving out here?

413
00:51:27,121 --> 00:51:29,539
Speaker 0: What kind of shit is this?

414
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:42,818
Speaker 0: These are the people.

415
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:47,039
Speaker 0: We need arrests.

416
00:51:48,341 --> 00:51:48,919
Speaker 0: Accountability.

417
00:51:53,328 --> 00:51:54,079
Speaker 0: We need arrests.

418
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,038
Speaker 0: Accountability.

419
00:51:56,986 --> 00:51:57,779
Speaker 0: That's what we need.

420
00:52:15,051 --> 00:52:19,210
Speaker 0: That's what we need.

421
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,128
Speaker 0: Watch them from behind now.

422
00:52:22,941 --> 00:52:23,909
Speaker 0: She's got the stick now.

423
00:52:26,473 --> 00:52:28,780
Speaker 0: We need a better system.

424
00:52:32,131 --> 00:52:32,979
Speaker 0: We need police.

425
00:52:33,741 --> 00:52:35,699
Speaker 0: Working on relationships with communities.

426
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:37,699
Speaker 0: That's what we need.

427
00:52:39,549 --> 00:52:40,380
Speaker 0: We don't need robots.

428
00:52:41,106 --> 00:52:42,840
Speaker 0: We don't need robots.

429
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,040
Speaker 0: We need people.

430
00:52:44,643 --> 00:52:45,700
Speaker 0: Connecting with people.

431
00:52:49,722 --> 00:52:51,129
Speaker 0: We don't want machines.

432
00:53:19,271 --> 00:53:41,399
Speaker 0: There's a white supremacist stabbing people a couple blocks down.

433
00:53:42,764 --> 00:53:44,219
Speaker 0: Who do I call about that?

434
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:44,755
Speaker 0: What do I do?

435
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:46,278
Speaker 0: What?

436
00:53:48,605 --> 00:53:49,840
Speaker 0: You guys are not in one one.

437
00:54:00,702 --> 00:54:00,868
Speaker 0: What?

438
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:10,544
Speaker 0: What?

439
00:54:44,272 --> 00:54:45,186
Speaker 0: How do we get out?

440
00:54:45,711 --> 00:54:46,810
Speaker 0: Stewart's all the way down there.

441
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,130
Speaker 0: I have to go that way.

442
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:49,888
Speaker 0: How do I get out?

443
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,450
Speaker 0: Is there any way to get out of here?

444
00:54:52,475 --> 00:54:52,785
Speaker 0: Thank you.

445
00:54:53,712 --> 00:54:54,989
Speaker 0: You came here without a plan?

446
00:55:07,382 --> 00:55:07,508
Speaker 0: Yep.

447
00:55:08,232 --> 00:55:09,535
Speaker 0: Am I supposed to be?

448
00:55:21,466 --> 00:55:22,119
Speaker 0: What, it shut off?

449
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:47,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, so... I hope you boxed them all in here and then hit them with the glass.

450
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:50,271
Speaker 0: Where are you going?

451
00:56:03,184 --> 00:56:03,273
Speaker 0: Home.

452
00:56:03,803 --> 00:56:04,279
Speaker 0: Where is home?

453
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,719
Speaker 0: Like, we need to get to a train station.

454
00:56:09,093 --> 00:56:11,649
Speaker 0: We're going to have to get to... Government Center?

455
00:56:12,511 --> 00:56:12,945
Speaker 0: Go up?

456
00:56:15,517 --> 00:56:16,149
Speaker 0: Go up this way.

457
00:56:17,325 --> 00:56:17,430
Speaker 0: Yep.

458
00:56:17,714 --> 00:56:18,689
Speaker 0: It's going to go down the hill.

459
00:56:19,894 --> 00:56:20,729
Speaker 0: We confirm one.

460
00:56:32,941 --> 00:56:34,142
Speaker 0: Is there somebody else?

461
00:56:52,922 --> 00:56:53,400
Speaker 0: Where are you?

462
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,428
Speaker 0: Where are you at?

463
00:57:05,683 --> 00:57:08,390
Speaker 0: We'll be right away, sir.

464
00:57:24,473 --> 00:57:25,466
Speaker 0: What are you looking at?

465
00:57:30,491 --> 00:57:31,387
Speaker 0: There's a cruiser over there.

466
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:34,710
Speaker 0: It's stupid having the cruisers here.

467
00:58:01,961 --> 00:58:02,354
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

468
00:58:03,826 --> 00:58:05,660
Speaker 0: I'm at Chelsea.

469
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,259
Speaker 0: They've got crowds surrounding the cruiser there.

470
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:17,998
Speaker 0: That's where they go.

471
00:58:19,221 --> 00:58:19,740
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

472
00:58:20,784 --> 00:58:21,820
Speaker 0: Get my shirt from him, please!

473
00:58:22,823 --> 00:58:24,060
Speaker 0: Get my shirt from him, please!

474
00:58:28,852 --> 00:58:30,449
Speaker 0: You've got to hold tight and watch the cruiser.

475
00:58:31,705 --> 00:58:32,009
Speaker 0: Ah, fuck.

Speaker 0: Educate our police officers.

482
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:01,058
Speaker 0: Lawyers spend eight years learning football and history.

01:03:01,501 --> 01:03:01,938
Speaker 0: What about you?

484
01:03:05,592 --> 01:03:06,085

Speaker 0: Stop it, officer.

487
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,273
Speaker 0: I'm going home right now.

488
01:03:35,685 --> 01:03:37,259
Speaker 0: I want to go down to Charles or Boylston.

489
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:38,119
Speaker 0: That way.

490
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,438
Speaker 0: You know Charles?

491
01:03:41,704 --> 01:03:42,112
Speaker 0: Thank you.

492
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,772
Speaker 0: Quick question.

493
01:04:38,511 --> 01:04:43,589
Speaker 0: Since the trains and buses are closed down, are you guys covering all the streets?

494
01:04:44,694 --> 01:04:45,110
Speaker 0: We don't know.

495
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:45,670
Speaker 0: We're just staying here.

496
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:47,477
Speaker 0: So there's really an exit for MSS.

497
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:55,068
Speaker 0: If I want to go home, I'm going to stay for another few minutes.

498
01:06:21,134 --> 01:06:22,249
Speaker 0: We're going running up there again.

499
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:01,503
Speaker 0: No.

500
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:02,938
Speaker 0: No, you can't.

501
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:04,149
Speaker 0: The cruiser now.

502
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:26,319
Speaker 0: Go this way.

503
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:36,890
Speaker 0: We have to go up and around.

504
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:25,210
Speaker 0: Are you going to eat?

505
01:13:08,804 --> 01:13:09,679

Speaker 0: Walk in that way.

509
01:13:19,072 --> 01:13:20,309
Speaker 0: It's probably an incendiary.

510
01:13:48,612 --> 01:13:49,109
Speaker 0: You got yours?

511
01:13:50,376 --> 01:13:51,069
Speaker 0: You got your mask?

512
01:13:52,575 --> 01:13:53,001
Speaker 0: It's on?

01:13:53,184 --> 01:13:53,549

02:33:33,141 --> 02:33:34,518
Speaker 0: Don't let them walk up behind us.

1000
02:33:51,058 --> 02:33:51,448
Speaker 0: Where you going?

1001
02:33:54,729 --> 02:33:55,098
Speaker 0: Where you going?

1002
02:34:25,955 --> 02:34:26,068
Speaker 0: Huh?

1003
02:34:31,870 --> 02:34:32,619
Speaker 0: I don't know what they're doing.

1004
02:34:43,663 --> 02:34:46,260
Speaker 0: All they're doing is driving them to another place that they're gonna break into.

1005
02:36:31,080 --> 02:36:32,318
Speaker 0: Are you guys still walking?

1006
02:36:44,888 --> 02:36:46,059
Speaker 0: I'll be out here all night, pal.

1007
02:40:06,776 --> 02:40:07,087
Speaker 0: What's that?

1008
02:40:07,430 --> 02:40:09,009
Speaker 0: I don't know how we got all the way over on this side.

1009
02:40:09,190 --> 02:40:09,570
Speaker 0: I don't either.

1010
02:40:10,010 --> 02:40:12,449
Speaker 0: There's no sense, because all they're doing is pushing them other places.

1011
02:40:12,830 --> 02:40:13,569
Speaker 0: We gotta stop them.

1012
02:40:14,753 --> 02:40:18,769
Speaker 0: You know, they're letting them filter out to all the other streets, which they're just gonna damage someplace else.

1013
02:40:19,370 --> 02:40:23,630
Speaker 0: Well, they didn't do anything to that block, so let's push them up there, let them trash that place.

1014
02:40:31,366 --> 02:40:31,860
Speaker 0: I know.

1015
02:40:32,341 --> 02:40:34,040
Speaker 0: This is like all Antifa kids.

1016
02:40:34,345 --> 02:40:34,480
Speaker 0: Huh?

1017
02:40:34,783 --> 02:40:36,658
Speaker 0: All these kids are like pretty much Antifa now.

1018
02:40:38,760 --> 02:40:38,845
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1019
02:40:39,562 --> 02:40:43,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think all that's left is all Antifa.

1020
02:40:46,311 --> 02:40:46,480
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1021
02:40:51,122 --> 02:40:52,900
Speaker 0: Mike was saying, anybody passed on what street?

1022
02:40:52,940 --> 02:40:54,399
Speaker 0: So he's gotta be at the car now.

1023
02:40:55,300 --> 02:40:58,418
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just texted him, because I saw that he calls, and I told him where we were.

1024
02:40:59,161 --> 02:41:01,340
Speaker 0: I'd like it if he could get, if he could get, if he could get somebody.

1025
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:15,126
Speaker 0: Lost.

1026
02:41:15,721 --> 02:41:16,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you pushed them up there.

1027
02:41:16,880 --> 02:41:17,779
Speaker 0: What do you think they were gonna do?

1028
02:41:49,940 --> 02:41:50,048
Speaker 0: Sarge.

1029
02:42:00,402 --> 02:42:00,777
Speaker 0: Sarge.

1030
02:42:01,645 --> 02:42:01,958
Speaker 0: Sarge.

1031
02:42:02,760 --> 02:42:05,000
Speaker 0: Will you text Jason and let him know we're here?

1032
02:42:06,214 --> 02:42:06,360
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1033
02:42:07,027 --> 02:42:07,539
Speaker 0: I can't do this.

1034
02:42:08,301 --> 02:42:09,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

1035
02:42:09,140 --> 02:42:09,340
Speaker 0: I got it.

1036
02:42:17,027 --> 02:42:17,860
Speaker 0: Good job, boys.

1037
02:42:18,740 --> 02:42:18,928
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

1038
02:42:19,720 --> 02:42:19,929
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

1039
02:42:20,200 --> 02:42:20,380
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

1040
02:42:52,280 --> 02:42:52,403
Speaker 0: Fuck.

1041
02:42:54,820 --> 02:42:55,818
Speaker 0: I fucked up my hand.

1042
02:42:56,821 --> 02:42:57,400
Speaker 0: You all right?

1043
02:42:58,661 --> 02:42:59,540
Speaker 0: You all right?

1044
02:43:00,515 --> 02:43:00,679
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1045
02:43:06,067 --> 02:43:08,740
Speaker 0: I got some big metal from the fire.

1046
02:43:09,384 --> 02:43:10,280
Speaker 0: Things in front of the building?

1047
02:43:10,461 --> 02:43:11,538
Speaker 0: Right off my chest, man.

1048
02:43:15,862 --> 02:43:17,520
Speaker 0: I don't know if I broke my knuckle.

1049
02:43:19,440 --> 02:43:20,039
Speaker 0: Did you move it?

1050
02:43:20,647 --> 02:43:20,740
Speaker 0: Huh?

1051
02:43:21,067 --> 02:43:21,419
Speaker 0: Did you move it?

1052
02:43:21,644 --> 02:43:21,778
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1053
02:43:22,581 --> 02:43:24,199
Speaker 0: But now it's getting, it's getting sore now.

1054
02:43:25,762 --> 02:43:28,400
Speaker 0: This happened when we were on Winter Street.

1055
02:43:31,340 --> 02:43:32,497
Speaker 0: It's chasing them, like.

1056
02:43:32,866 --> 02:43:32,998
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1057
02:43:40,183 --> 02:43:42,600
Speaker 0: And these people are the same people just driving around looking for.

1058
02:45:26,743 --> 02:45:28,279
Speaker 0: They just look at it cause damage.

1059
02:45:28,580 --> 02:45:29,339
Speaker 0: Is this the same group?

1060
02:45:29,480 --> 02:45:30,280
Speaker 0: No, different, different.

1061
02:45:48,540 --> 02:45:48,735
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

1062
02:45:49,340 --> 02:45:49,529
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

1063
02:46:18,438 --> 02:46:19,370
Speaker 0: Good job parking there.

1064
02:46:21,254 --> 02:46:22,570
Speaker 0: They were all over your car, dude.

1065
02:46:24,394 --> 02:46:25,829
Speaker 0: They were climbing all over your car.

1066
02:46:32,736 --> 02:46:33,450
Speaker 0: Welcome to Boston.

1067
02:46:33,833 --> 02:46:34,188
Speaker 0: Come again.

1068
02:46:46,170 --> 02:46:46,426
Speaker 0: How are you?

1069
02:47:01,240 --> 02:47:01,354
Speaker 0: Huh?

1070
02:47:01,843 --> 02:47:02,760
Speaker 0: At least this is quiet.

1071
02:47:02,944 --> 02:47:03,053
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1072
02:47:03,600 --> 02:47:04,257
Speaker 0: Are your ears ringing?

1073
02:47:04,582 --> 02:47:04,978
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

1074
02:47:05,400 --> 02:47:07,800
Speaker 0: My talk, I can hear my, there's like a beeping.

1075
02:47:08,348 --> 02:47:08,600
Speaker 0: My radio.

1076
02:47:10,080 --> 02:47:10,405
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

1077
02:47:27,880 --> 02:47:28,100
Speaker 0: This is it.

1078
02:47:53,440 --> 02:47:54,059
Speaker 0: They just split up.

1079
02:47:54,341 --> 02:47:56,940
Speaker 0: Some fucking cops are spraying the shit out of the cops.

1080
02:47:57,161 --> 02:47:57,678
Speaker 0: Did you see that?

1081
02:47:58,140 --> 02:47:58,193
Speaker 0: No.

1082
02:48:03,442 --> 02:48:04,198
Speaker 0: Are they back there now?

1083
02:48:04,560 --> 02:48:04,603
Speaker 0: No.

1084
02:48:10,692 --> 02:48:13,150
Speaker 0: All they did was splinter off so we don't have enough people.

1085
02:48:14,732 --> 02:48:17,229
Speaker 0: And then they just keep doing what they want.

1086
02:48:19,032 --> 02:48:20,509
Speaker 0: Nobody should be coming up these streets.

1087
02:48:23,484 --> 02:48:24,700
Speaker 0: These people don't live on this street.

1088
02:48:25,943 --> 02:48:27,579
Speaker 0: They're here to do one thing, cause mayhem.

1089
02:48:30,591 --> 02:48:34,070
Speaker 0: It's the Antifa people and they suck all these other people into doing the same thing.

1090
02:48:34,310 --> 02:48:36,030
Speaker 0: Look at them throwing shit around over there.

1091
02:49:18,251 --> 02:49:22,470
Speaker 0: Four young girls trashing the plants in front of Webster Bank.

1092
02:49:26,013 --> 02:49:26,869
Speaker 0: And we sit and watch.

1093
02:49:59,934 --> 02:50:01,410
Speaker 0: The superintendent told us to stay here?

1094
02:50:02,330 --> 02:50:02,525
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1095
02:50:08,405 --> 02:50:09,398
Speaker 0: I don't know what's going on.

1096
02:50:09,581 --> 02:50:11,519
Speaker 0: Do you want to head up to Floyd Taylor's?

1097
02:50:12,482 --> 02:50:13,639
Speaker 0: No, they got shopping bags.

1098
02:50:14,480 --> 02:50:15,240
Speaker 0: They're all excited.

1099
02:50:22,983 --> 02:50:25,060
Speaker 0: He said, you go on that side, stay on that side.

1100
02:50:25,200 --> 02:50:26,140
Speaker 0: State's going to stay on that side.

1101
02:50:26,420 --> 02:50:27,019
Speaker 0: But State's gone.

1102
02:50:38,996 --> 02:50:39,690
Speaker 0: That was the business.

1103
02:50:40,152 --> 02:50:42,150
Speaker 0: Every business should be calling the mayor's office.

1104
02:50:43,590 --> 02:50:44,628
Speaker 0: And saying stuff to the DA.

1105
02:50:46,196 --> 02:50:46,648
Speaker 0: She doesn't care.

1106
02:50:47,152 --> 02:50:47,688
Speaker 0: No, she doesn't.

1107
02:52:24,447 --> 02:52:25,000
Speaker 0: Look at this girl.

1108
02:52:25,120 --> 02:52:27,039
Speaker 0: All the shopping bags and her friends.

1109
02:52:28,602 --> 02:52:29,460
Speaker 0: No stores are open.

1110
02:52:30,921 --> 02:52:33,259
Speaker 0: Walking down the street with all the shopping bags.

1111
02:52:35,501 --> 02:52:36,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hope you get into an accident.

1112
02:52:36,640 --> 02:52:39,600
Speaker 0: Hope undoubtedly broke into a store up the street.

1113
02:52:40,161 --> 02:52:40,858
Speaker 0: Filled with stuff.

1114
02:53:07,968 --> 02:53:09,090
Speaker 0: What are we protesting, yeah?

1115
02:53:34,822 --> 02:53:36,396
Speaker 0: Looks like they hit the Adidas store, huh?

1116
02:54:02,603 --> 02:54:04,239
Speaker 0: Haven't heard that one in a while on dogs.

1117
02:55:03,306 --> 02:55:03,980
Speaker 0: Maybe this worked.

1118
02:55:04,100 --> 02:55:05,420
Speaker 0: Nobody in the hood got shot tonight.

1119
02:55:39,746 --> 02:55:40,600
Speaker 0: They got the liquor store.

1120
02:55:44,565 --> 02:55:45,480
Speaker 0: His arm's all bleeding.

1121
02:55:46,184 --> 02:55:46,739
Speaker 0: Hope it was worth it.

1122
02:55:51,408 --> 02:55:52,280
Speaker 0: How y'all doing today?

1123
02:55:53,441 --> 02:55:54,019
Speaker 0: Getting tired.

1124
02:55:54,960 --> 02:55:55,269
Speaker 0: Getting tired.

1125
02:56:01,646 --> 02:56:02,260
Speaker 0: Shaki Allah.

1126
02:57:53,905 --> 02:58:32,769
Speaker 0: They just, they just... Fucked up two cruises.

1127
02:58:34,358 --> 02:58:34,708
Speaker 0: Exit up.

1128
02:58:35,852 --> 02:58:36,569
Speaker 0: Which is up that way.

1129
02:58:39,176 --> 02:58:40,129
Speaker 0: I don't know who, who, who, who.

1130
02:59:01,422 --> 02:59:02,699
Speaker 0: Drive safe, no wheelies.

1131
02:59:43,269 --> 02:59:43,394
Speaker 0: Eat it.

1132
02:59:44,382 --> 02:59:45,279
Speaker 0: Stop playing.

1133
03:00:03,380 --> 03:00:03,447
Speaker 0: Shh.

1134
03:00:10,240 --> 03:00:11,341
Speaker 0: Yeah, they are smashing behind here.

1135
03:00:41,966 --> 03:00:42,919
Speaker 0: Oh, I thought it was over here.

1136
03:00:45,313 --> 03:00:45,520
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

1137
03:00:50,406 --> 03:00:51,220
Speaker 0: They're looking down there.

1138
03:00:51,621 --> 03:00:53,140
Speaker 0: I got my fucking earpiece in here.

1139
03:00:55,720 --> 03:00:55,803
Speaker 0: What?

1140
03:00:59,462 --> 03:01:00,257
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

1141
03:01:45,075 --> 03:01:45,769
Speaker 0: Call for one.

1142
03:02:44,071 --> 03:02:47,584
Speaker 0: Might have just made my night if... Huh?

1143
03:02:48,181 --> 03:02:50,420
Speaker 0: That would have made my night if that transpired like I thought it would.

1144
03:02:50,484 --> 03:02:50,593
Speaker 0: Yes.

1145
03:03:20,686 --> 03:03:21,278
Speaker 0: The aquarium.

1146
03:03:22,169 --> 03:03:22,539
Speaker 0: Oh, fuck.

1147
03:03:22,764 --> 03:03:22,910
Speaker 0: Jesus.

1148
03:03:25,091 --> 03:03:25,680
Speaker 0: I can't swim.

1149
03:03:26,162 --> 03:03:27,039
Speaker 0: Call the scuba team.

1150
03:05:27,229 --> 03:05:30,090
Speaker 0: We're letting them do it.

1151
03:05:34,161 --> 03:05:36,359
Speaker 0: I hope I wake up tomorrow and I can get out of my bag.

1152
03:05:37,602 --> 03:05:44,360
Speaker 0: I'm ending school making camp at my house tomorrow.

1153
03:05:45,222 --> 03:05:46,680
Speaker 0: It's my decision I'm making tonight.

1154
03:05:47,020 --> 03:05:47,128
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1155
03:06:16,922 --> 03:07:21,760
Speaker 0: No, they were just fucking going to break into a store across the street, so... Nobody seems to care.

1156
03:10:22,885 --> 03:10:23,660
Speaker 0: What's the bike lane?

1157
03:10:36,721 --> 03:11:30,163
Speaker 0: We're not going to the aquarium for operation.

1158
03:13:51,812 --> 03:13:52,469
Speaker 0: Free the fishes.

1159
03:14:08,737 --> 03:14:15,280
Speaker 0: I don't know what day it is anymore.

1160
03:14:19,640 --> 03:14:20,220
Speaker 0: It's about now, right?

1161
03:14:23,310 --> 03:14:23,710
Speaker 0: I'm stoked.

1162
03:14:25,077 --> 03:14:25,888
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

1163
03:14:26,130 --> 03:14:26,195
Speaker 0: Yes.

1164
03:14:26,430 --> 03:14:27,969
Speaker 0: Are we smelling that shit for the rest of my life?

1165
03:15:12,146 --> 03:15:12,620
Speaker 0: In the eighties.

1166
03:15:12,681 --> 03:15:13,359
Speaker 0: I thought that was us.

1167
03:15:13,900 --> 03:15:13,945
Speaker 0: No.

1168
03:15:15,482 --> 03:15:16,799
Speaker 0: Who the fuck drove that?

1169
03:15:16,960 --> 03:15:17,559
Speaker 0: It's very messy.

1170
03:15:17,742 --> 03:15:18,220
Speaker 0: Hey, I'm sorry.

1171
03:15:18,360 --> 03:15:19,599
Speaker 0: That's how it worked in the proper tunes.

1172
03:15:19,800 --> 03:15:23,280
Speaker 0: I thought we were going to be like going in there and... Oh, that was totally disorganized.

1173
03:15:23,460 --> 03:15:23,840
Speaker 0: That's the worst.

1174
03:15:24,701 --> 03:15:26,860
Speaker 0: Be prepared to go to Victory Road for more training.

1175
03:15:27,931 --> 03:15:28,860
Speaker 0: I missed the mounted unit.

1176
03:15:31,988 --> 03:15:33,176
Speaker 0: I'm surprised.

1177
03:15:34,161 --> 03:15:35,695
Speaker 0: I know we all do our best to get out of that EDT training.

1178
03:15:39,997 --> 03:15:40,489
Speaker 0: More people?

1179
03:15:41,031 --> 03:15:41,670
Speaker 0: Like, in the comments?

1180
03:15:41,830 --> 03:15:42,750
Speaker 0: Man, that was crazy.

1181
03:16:21,286 --> 03:16:22,019
Speaker 0: You can unmask him.

1182
03:16:22,966 --> 03:16:23,459
Speaker 0: You can unmask him.

1183
03:19:09,023 --> 03:19:09,919
Speaker 0: Fucking job, Boston.

1184
03:19:10,360 --> 03:19:10,440
Speaker 0: Huh?

1185
03:20:21,374 --> 03:20:22,748
Speaker 0: Jackie, you need anything in the cruiser?

1186
03:20:23,534 --> 03:20:24,470
Speaker 0: I think he locked it, though.

1187
03:20:33,195 --> 03:20:33,750
Speaker 0: Sorry, guys.

1188
03:20:33,891 --> 03:20:34,704
Speaker 0: It's fucking absolute shit.

1189
03:20:55,673 --> 03:20:56,449
Speaker 0: Good for you, Mike.

1190
03:21:33,153 --> 03:21:33,668
Speaker 0: Hey, what's up?

1191
03:21:34,855 --> 03:21:35,610
Speaker 0: John, I thought you was driving.

1192
03:21:35,690 --> 03:21:36,290
Speaker 0: You drove a bit.

1193
03:21:37,013 --> 03:21:37,207
Speaker 0: John.

1194
03:21:38,399 --> 03:21:38,650
Speaker 0: What's up?

1195
03:21:38,916 --> 03:21:39,430
Speaker 0: Did you have a card?

1196
03:21:39,750 --> 03:21:39,822
Speaker 0: Huh?

1197
03:21:40,373 --> 03:21:41,109
Speaker 0: Did you have a card on you?

1198
03:21:42,332 --> 03:21:44,449
Speaker 0: No, another guy, Mike Ford, was driving it.

1199
03:21:44,914 --> 03:21:44,957
Speaker 0: Oh.

1200
03:21:45,912 --> 03:21:47,509
Speaker 0: I just wanted to make sure it wasn't broken into.

1201
03:21:48,674 --> 03:21:49,349
Speaker 0: That van right there?

1202
03:21:49,790 --> 03:21:49,922
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1203
03:21:54,384 --> 03:21:54,757
Speaker 0: Good job, son.

1204
03:22:29,469 --> 03:22:29,839
Speaker 0: What's up, guys?

1205
03:22:30,220 --> 03:22:30,677
Speaker 0: What's up, Jack?

1206
03:22:36,624 --> 03:22:37,780
Speaker 0: I think he broke my knuckle.

1207
03:22:37,980 --> 03:22:38,579
Speaker 0: You're kidding me.

1208
03:22:38,663 --> 03:22:38,706
Speaker 0: No.

1209
03:22:39,320 --> 03:22:39,939
Speaker 0: Go get a look at it.

1210
03:22:40,605 --> 03:22:41,038
Speaker 0: Later on.

1211
03:22:41,260 --> 03:22:41,636
Speaker 0: Later on.

1212
03:22:42,101 --> 03:22:42,979
Speaker 0: Too much stuff going on.

1213
03:22:43,080 --> 03:22:43,338
Speaker 0: Too much fun.

1214
03:22:43,380 --> 03:22:44,075
Speaker 0: Maybe it's the aquarium match.

1215
03:22:44,680 --> 03:22:44,787
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1216
03:23:13,286 --> 03:23:13,739
Speaker 0: Come on, Ollie.

1217
03:23:29,831 --> 03:23:30,706
Speaker 0: Did you not snag that at all?

1218
03:23:31,030 --> 03:23:31,263
Speaker 0: I'm bad, man.

1219
03:23:54,223 --> 03:23:54,756
Speaker 0: It's a rematch.

1220
03:23:55,040 --> 03:23:55,333
Speaker 0: It's a rematch.

1221
03:23:56,681 --> 03:23:57,000
Speaker 0: It's a rematch.

1222
03:23:59,300 --> 03:23:59,580
Speaker 0: It's a rematch.

1223
03:24:08,911 --> 03:24:10,307
Speaker 0: It's a rematch.

1224
03:24:10,950 --> 03:24:20,770
Speaker 0: You know, with Joe Joe, probably the stupidest I can ever think of, that's probably the first thing Cesar did.

1225
03:24:20,830 --> 03:24:22,205
Speaker 0: that left me.

1226
03:24:23,211 --> 03:24:24,709
Speaker 0: He drove in his car and left me behind.

1227
03:24:25,410 --> 03:24:26,745
Speaker 0: The first thing he did was go home.

1228
03:24:26,826 --> 03:24:26,988
Speaker 0: he go.

1229
03:24:29,312 --> 03:24:29,970
Speaker 0: I called him.

1230
03:24:30,050 --> 03:24:31,069
Speaker 0: I tried calling him like three times.

1231
03:24:32,010 --> 03:24:32,507
Speaker 0: but it just doesn't, like.

1232
03:24:34,576 --> 03:24:35,127
Speaker 0: Wouldn't surprise me.

1233
03:24:35,530 --> 03:24:35,943
Speaker 0: Wouldn't surprise me.

1234
03:24:37,011 --> 03:24:38,302
Speaker 0: It's not that he doesn't have one.

1235
03:24:39,918 --> 03:24:40,168
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

1236
03:24:40,230 --> 03:24:40,870
Speaker 0: He doesn't have one.

1237
03:24:42,677 --> 03:24:43,350
Speaker 0: I'm very disappointed.

1238
03:25:12,011 --> 03:25:12,200
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1239
03:25:15,225 --> 03:25:15,975
Speaker 0: I don't have my gas mask.

1240
03:25:17,182 --> 03:25:17,678
Speaker 0: It's in the van.

1241
03:25:17,880 --> 03:25:17,946
Speaker 0: Huh?

1242
03:25:18,640 --> 03:25:19,340
Speaker 0: It's in the van, right?

1243
03:25:20,507 --> 03:25:20,675
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

1244
03:25:21,440 --> 03:25:21,840
Speaker 0: Is that all right?

1245
03:25:22,569 --> 03:25:22,720
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1246
03:25:22,960 --> 03:25:23,380
Speaker 0: I'm totally fine.

1247
03:25:23,760 --> 03:25:24,420
Speaker 0: Do you want some water?

1248
03:25:25,072 --> 03:25:25,219
Speaker 0: Nope.

1249
03:25:30,227 --> 03:25:31,239
Speaker 0: I need to take a leak though.

1250
03:25:32,288 --> 03:25:32,899
Speaker 0: I need to take a leak.

1251
03:25:33,040 --> 03:25:33,860
Speaker 0: What are all these people doing?

1252
03:25:34,400 --> 03:25:34,653
Speaker 0: Shopping.

1253
03:25:40,373 --> 03:25:40,520
Speaker 0: Huh?

1254
03:26:03,009 --> 03:26:03,380
Speaker 0: Oh can you?

1255
03:26:04,305 --> 03:26:04,639
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1256
03:26:06,104 --> 03:26:06,760
Speaker 0: I said can we?

1257
03:26:08,492 --> 03:26:08,600
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1258
03:26:08,827 --> 03:26:09,000
Speaker 0: It is.

1259
03:26:12,566 --> 03:26:13,500
Speaker 0: The captain told us to, right?

1260
03:26:14,084 --> 03:26:14,173
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1261
03:26:22,880 --> 03:26:24,299
Speaker 0: It was Jackson Place, right there.

1262
03:26:40,822 --> 03:26:44,820
Speaker 0: I was trying to dump out every water bottle because all they're gonna do is pick it up and throw it again.

1263
03:26:45,401 --> 03:26:46,232
Speaker 0: I think they locked it.

1264
03:26:59,746 --> 03:27:00,258
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's locked.

1265
03:27:07,824 --> 03:27:12,320
Speaker 0: What do you think about it right here?

1266
03:27:14,022 --> 03:27:15,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's probably the best one just locked here.

1267
03:27:17,160 --> 03:27:18,257
Speaker 0: They gave us a code at one point.

1268
03:27:18,682 --> 03:27:19,257
Speaker 0: This used to be open.

1269
03:27:20,544 --> 03:27:21,500
Speaker 0: Let's take a walk and hit that.

1270
03:27:21,500 --> 03:27:22,119
Speaker 0: It's probably locked up.

1271
03:27:58,764 --> 03:27:59,620
Speaker 0: It's probably everywhere.

1272
03:28:17,143 --> 03:28:18,140
Speaker 0: There's another camera there.

1273
03:28:19,003 --> 03:28:20,540
Speaker 0: I'll hold it for now, fuck it, whatever.

1274
03:28:24,103 --> 03:28:29,619
Speaker 0: I want it to go when we're going down West Street with the big parking lots there next to Fajitas and Ritas.

1275
03:29:02,383 --> 03:29:03,680
Speaker 0: Oh, he can't let us in, right?

1276
03:29:04,640 --> 03:29:05,480
Speaker 0: He can't let anybody go behind, guys?

1277
03:29:36,152 --> 03:29:36,749
Speaker 0: Yes, sir, how you doing?

1278
03:29:36,972 --> 03:29:37,790
Speaker 0: Mind if we use your restroom?

1279
03:29:45,932 --> 03:29:47,348
Speaker 0: Not a problem, yeah, we appreciate it, thank you.

1280
03:30:11,481 --> 03:30:21,070
Speaker 0: Is there money for you to use the restroom?

1281
03:30:21,550 --> 03:30:21,827
Speaker 0: Yes, sir.

1282
03:30:22,131 --> 03:30:23,430
Speaker 0: All right, thank you, appreciate it.

1283
03:30:23,571 --> 03:30:23,930
Speaker 0: Not a problem.

1284
03:30:24,592 --> 03:30:25,408
Speaker 0: Is that the recline room?

1285
03:30:26,050 --> 03:30:27,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, yeah, I'm the recline window.

1286
03:30:27,934 --> 03:30:28,230
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

1287
03:30:28,430 --> 03:30:29,605
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1288
03:30:32,650 --> 03:30:33,590
Speaker 0: Guys, where's the restroom?

1289
03:30:34,332 --> 03:30:34,568
Speaker 0: Restroom?

1290
03:30:34,751 --> 03:30:35,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, men's room.

1291
03:30:35,892 --> 03:30:36,528
Speaker 0: Security gets you in.

1292
03:30:36,710 --> 03:30:37,229
Speaker 0: Where's the bathroom?

1293
03:30:37,451 --> 03:30:37,770
Speaker 0: Sorry, I'm sorry.

1294
03:30:37,933 --> 03:30:38,469
Speaker 0: Do you have the keys?

1295
03:30:38,971 --> 03:30:39,258
Speaker 0: No, over there.

1296
03:30:39,850 --> 03:30:40,330
Speaker 0: You have the keys?

1297
03:30:40,976 --> 03:30:41,590
Speaker 0: Follow him, follow him.

1298
03:30:45,910 --> 03:30:46,216
Speaker 0: Come on, man.

1299
03:30:52,770 --> 03:30:53,509
Speaker 0: I don't feel much of this.

1300
03:30:53,771 --> 03:30:54,550
Speaker 0: Just a single room, sir.

1301
03:30:55,074 --> 03:30:55,729
Speaker 0: Oh, no, okay.

1302
03:30:56,714 --> 03:30:57,129
Speaker 0: You can share.

1303
03:30:59,451 --> 03:31:00,710
Speaker 0: Make sure you wash your hands first.

1304
03:31:04,957 --> 03:31:05,470
Speaker 0: You tell me.

1305
03:31:06,470 --> 03:31:07,209
Speaker 0: Are we all up your step?

1306
03:31:08,513 --> 03:31:09,829
Speaker 0: Don't touch it, there's blood all over it.

1307
03:31:10,373 --> 03:31:10,501
Speaker 0: Thanks.

1308
03:31:11,250 --> 03:31:11,967
Speaker 0: That yours, is it?

1309
03:31:13,359 --> 03:31:13,629
Speaker 0: Thanks, man.

1310
03:32:16,833 --> 03:32:17,079
Speaker 0: All set.

1311
03:32:21,042 --> 03:32:22,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I forgot to shut off my camera.

1312
03:32:23,540 --> 03:32:24,935
Speaker 0: I'm not washing my fucking pepper spray off.

1313
03:32:26,094 --> 03:32:26,157
Speaker 0: Huh?

1314
03:32:26,623 --> 03:32:28,020
Speaker 0: I'm not washing my pepper spray off yet.

1315
03:32:29,791 --> 03:32:29,959
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1316
03:32:32,783 --> 03:32:35,159
Speaker 0: Oh, I took this big thing off my chest.

1317
03:32:35,864 --> 03:32:36,799
Speaker 0: I got a jet, broke this.

1318
03:32:38,922 --> 03:32:43,520
Speaker 0: One of those hose things that they have in front of the stores, big brass thing.

1319
03:32:44,563 --> 03:32:45,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got one of those hooked up, man.

1320
03:32:46,640 --> 03:32:47,559
Speaker 0: Bricks, you got any bricks?

1321
03:32:47,782 --> 03:32:48,138
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh yeah.

1322
03:32:48,280 --> 03:32:48,959
Speaker 0: That's what hit me here.

1323
03:32:50,121 --> 03:32:50,839
Speaker 0: You all right, dude?

1324
03:32:50,900 --> 03:32:51,619
Speaker 0: You should probably get that.

1325
03:32:51,760 --> 03:32:52,111
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't know.

1326
03:32:52,420 --> 03:32:54,420
Speaker 0: I never broke a bone, so I don't know how it feels.

1327
03:32:55,283 --> 03:32:55,979
Speaker 0: You like, mended it?

1328
03:32:56,362 --> 03:32:57,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

1329
03:32:57,180 --> 03:32:59,440
Speaker 0: I think it's, my knuckle's a little messed up.

1330
03:33:00,660 --> 03:33:00,724
Speaker 0: Huh?

1331
03:33:01,282 --> 03:33:02,120
Speaker 0: It's probably not broke.

1332
03:33:02,200 --> 03:33:03,097
Speaker 0: It's probably fucked all over.

1333
03:33:04,204 --> 03:33:04,738
Speaker 0: It's gonna take a while.

1334
03:33:04,840 --> 03:33:08,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm not taking this thing off until I'm, my toe over, man.

1335
03:33:08,402 --> 03:33:08,880
Speaker 0: It's gonna bleed it.

1336
03:33:09,387 --> 03:33:09,476
Speaker 0: Huh?

1337
03:33:09,803 --> 03:33:10,516
Speaker 0: It'll probably bleed everywhere.

1338
03:33:10,821 --> 03:33:11,537
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1339
03:33:14,101 --> 03:33:14,369
Speaker 0: We're good.

1340
03:33:16,925 --> 03:33:17,799
Speaker 0: Can't leave you guys alone.

1341
03:33:18,040 --> 03:33:19,280
Speaker 0: Can't abandon my people.

1342
03:33:22,541 --> 03:33:23,699
Speaker 0: We haven't locked anybody up, man.

1343
03:33:23,921 --> 03:33:24,620
Speaker 0: It's just ridiculous.

1344
03:33:30,417 --> 03:33:31,010
Speaker 0: I'm embarrassed.

1345
03:33:32,970 --> 03:33:33,283
Speaker 0: Embarrassed.

1346
03:33:35,413 --> 03:33:37,030
Speaker 0: Most embarrassing day as a police officer.

1347
03:34:02,730 --> 03:34:03,098
Speaker 0: Yo, I'm sorry, guys.

1348
03:34:03,831 --> 03:34:05,086
Speaker 0: I gotta deal with that bullshit, man.

1349
03:34:06,832 --> 03:34:09,050
Speaker 0: We ain't, it ain't about George Floyd.

1350
03:34:09,894 --> 03:34:10,388
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

1351
03:34:10,592 --> 03:34:10,637
Speaker 0: No.

1352
03:34:11,251 --> 03:34:13,850
Speaker 0: It was until people started doing all this bullshit.

1353
03:34:13,890 --> 03:34:16,770
Speaker 0: Good protesters are with their message.

1354
03:34:17,334 --> 03:34:18,410
Speaker 0: We share the same sentiment.

1355
03:34:18,790 --> 03:34:20,009
Speaker 0: We do not like what happened.

1356
03:34:21,230 --> 03:34:28,189
Speaker 0: But Luton, Antifa, and Luton, and all that crap that's going on, what's that do?

1357
03:34:28,551 --> 03:34:29,789
Speaker 0: It destroys your message.

1358
03:34:31,253 --> 03:34:34,229
Speaker 0: Because now the average American's going, this ain't about that guy.

1359
03:34:36,113 --> 03:34:38,230
Speaker 0: That happened in Minnesota, Minneapolis.

1360
03:34:39,193 --> 03:34:40,369
Speaker 0: What's that got to do with Boston?

1361
03:34:41,356 --> 03:34:42,409
Speaker 0: My city, my town.

1362
03:34:43,113 --> 03:34:44,169
Speaker 0: I was born and raised here.

1363
03:34:45,413 --> 03:34:48,309
Speaker 0: This is the most embarrassing day in my career, at twenty-five years.

1364
03:34:50,551 --> 03:34:53,370
Speaker 0: And it's crazy because, like, I can say this because I'm black.

1365
03:34:54,010 --> 03:35:03,410
Speaker 0: It's like, niggas talk about fuck five-o, fuck the police, and all that other shit, but when something happens, you guys are the first people they call.

1366
03:35:05,377 --> 03:35:05,950
Speaker 0: You know what I mean?

1367
03:35:06,030 --> 03:35:14,550
Speaker 0: Like, me and my guy, like, we was dealing with a person just like us, just out and out for no reason, trying to fight.

1368
03:35:14,670 --> 03:35:16,290
Speaker 0: When we walked up to him, I'm like, yo, what the hell?

1369
03:35:16,971 --> 03:35:17,665
Speaker 0: What are you trying to prove?

1370
03:35:18,151 --> 03:35:19,246
Speaker 0: There's no message in that.

1371
03:35:19,930 --> 03:35:27,690
Speaker 0: And then, when we got in his face, he wanted to back off, and then talk about, oh, you know what, fuck you, guy, you and the police, and y'all with them niggas.

1372
03:35:27,851 --> 03:35:29,129
Speaker 0: I'm like, I'm a security guard.

1373
03:35:29,933 --> 03:35:31,209
Speaker 0: I was smoking a cigarette.

1374
03:35:33,191 --> 03:35:34,666
Speaker 0: So, I feel for you guys, man.

1375
03:35:36,072 --> 03:35:37,090
Speaker 0: I really appreciate it, man, thanks.

1376
03:35:42,400 --> 03:35:43,820
Speaker 0: Just like you guys see my last game.

1377
03:35:50,345 --> 03:35:51,259
Speaker 0: God bless, man.

1378
03:35:51,668 --> 03:35:51,999
Speaker 0: Be safe.

1379
03:36:31,419 --> 03:36:31,749
Speaker 0: What's up?

1380
03:36:33,495 --> 03:36:36,949
Speaker 0: I'm walking down Winter, towards the van.

1381
03:36:46,565 --> 03:36:47,699
Speaker 0: Do one of these things, dude.

1382
03:36:49,540 --> 03:36:50,620
Speaker 0: Except the fucking grass.

1383
03:36:50,680 --> 03:36:51,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe right in here.

1384
03:36:52,142 --> 03:36:55,360
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I got hit with one of those, and I didn't know what the hell it was.

1385
03:36:55,581 --> 03:36:57,720
Speaker 0: I didn't move, and then it hit me.

1386
03:36:57,720 --> 03:36:58,960
Speaker 0: It hit me, and it dropped on the ground.

1387
03:36:59,060 --> 03:37:00,019
Speaker 0: I picked it up, and I was like.

1388
03:37:01,781 --> 03:37:07,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, you let it happen.

1389
03:37:33,445 --> 03:37:34,200
Speaker 0: Should we shut her off now?
