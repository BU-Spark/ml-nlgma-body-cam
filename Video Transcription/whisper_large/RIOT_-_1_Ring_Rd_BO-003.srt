00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:19,310
Speaker 0: We got an officer down on a fire rescue, but he won't arrive that soon.

171
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:22,070
Speaker 0: >> An officer down at Tremont and Temple Place.

172
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:58,762
Speaker 0: >> Huh?

173
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:55,740
Speaker 0: >> McGrail?

174
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,999
Speaker 0: >> No.

175
00:35:56,999 --> 00:35:58,926
Speaker 0: >> He's probably back there.

176
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,240
Speaker 0: I thought he'd come over here, so why can't he?

177
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,638
Speaker 0: >> Right there.

178
00:36:01,638 --> 00:36:02,418
Speaker 0: >> Right?

179
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:03,959
Speaker 0: >> No, that's Aziz.

180
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:07,156
Speaker 0: >> No, I don't know who that is.

181
00:36:07,156 --> 00:36:10,605
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, it's a six-digit number.

182
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:11,828
Speaker 0: I don't think that's Hogarth.

183
00:36:11,828 --> 00:36:15,969
Speaker 0: >> McGrail doesn't have a vest on.

184
00:36:15,969 --> 00:36:19,382
Speaker 0: >> Oh, it's quite about 2-3.

185
00:36:19,382 --> 00:36:27,852
Speaker 0: >> Everything's out of this burden?

186
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:57,052
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

187
00:36:57,052 --> 00:37:03,416
Speaker 0: >> Where's the fire?

188
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:05,924
Speaker 0: >> Where's the fire?

189
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:15,319
Speaker 0: >> Let's wait till they leave.

190
00:37:15,319 --> 00:38:01,830
Speaker 0: >> So you just seen that, right?

191
00:38:02,392 --> 00:38:03,855
Speaker 0: Don't act like you ain't just seen that.

192
00:38:04,537 --> 00:38:05,480
Speaker 0: You didn't just see that shit?

193
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:05,955
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

194
00:38:05,955 --> 00:38:11,286
Speaker 0: >> So you just seen the waters end up on the wall like, "Huh?

195
00:38:11,366 --> 00:38:11,547
Speaker 0: Huh?".

196
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:15,813
Speaker 0: >> What's up, guys?

197
00:38:15,813 --> 00:38:27,222
Speaker 0: >> I wouldn't have to do a forced entry on this, right?

198
00:38:27,242 --> 00:38:28,389
Speaker 0: Because the window was already broken.

199
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,599
Speaker 0: >> Right.

200
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,265
Speaker 0: >> Oh, no, you know what?

201
00:38:32,305 --> 00:38:32,970
Speaker 0: You know what?

202
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:33,983
Speaker 0: >> No.

203
00:38:33,983 --> 00:38:35,869
Speaker 0: >> Can I just leave you?

204
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:37,850
Speaker 0: >> You've got to go 30 o'clock ahead.

205
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:38,535
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

206
00:38:38,535 --> 00:38:41,250
Speaker 0: >> See?

207
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,450
Speaker 0: >> Thank you, Elvin.

208
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,709
Speaker 0: >> That was the same person.

209
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:46,790
Speaker 0: >> But then the captain told me after that.

210
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:47,126
Speaker 0: >> The only one.

211
00:38:47,126 --> 00:38:48,467
Speaker 0: >> He's like, "I'm trying to

212
00:38:48,508 --> 00:38:48,610
Speaker 0: drill.".

213
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,410
Speaker 0: >> That was the last captain, yeah.

214
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,803
Speaker 0: >> Staff units in the oil center.

215
00:38:54,903 --> 00:38:55,466
Speaker 0: I'll correct that.

216
00:38:55,506 --> 00:38:56,390
Speaker 0: Newberry and Exeter, Captain.

217
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:04,530
Speaker 0: >> Last staff units to come in now.

218
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,769
Speaker 0: >> Where are we at?

219
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:07,529
Speaker 0: >> Huh?

220
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:09,280
Speaker 0: >> You're so elusive.

221
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:10,870
Speaker 0: I've lost you like nine times.

222
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,129
Speaker 0: >> I meant to move my cruiser.

223
00:39:12,129 --> 00:39:12,782
Speaker 0: >> Where are we?

224
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:15,570
Speaker 0: >> I locked it, too, even though all the windows are broken out.

225
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,310
Speaker 0: >> Was yours the one on Newberry?

226
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,069
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

227
00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:22,162
Speaker 0: >> That was the spare cruiser, though.

228
00:39:22,182 --> 00:39:23,390
Speaker 0: I took it because it didn't have the shotgun.

229
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,990
Speaker 0: >> Did you grab anything in there?

230
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,541
Speaker 0: >> Huh?

231
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:27,970
Speaker 0: >> Did you grab anything in there?

232
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:28,524
Speaker 0: >> No.

233
00:39:28,524 --> 00:39:32,809
Speaker 0: >> Somebody's about to give me $1.89 because he wanted to push me.

234
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:34,670
Speaker 0: >> You got it on the board as well?

235
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,343
Speaker 0: >> No.

236
00:39:35,343 --> 00:39:42,570
Speaker 0: >> We need a squad down at the oil center on Ring Road.

237
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:44,559
Speaker 0: We have a crew trying to break in the store.

238
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:46,650
Speaker 0: They're also attacking the people that are putting up the boarding.

239
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:54,200
Speaker 0: >> Is your mouth shut?

240
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:00,495
Speaker 0: >> It's my mouth shut as well.

241
00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:12,980
Speaker 0: >> Delta 9-0-2, fire's clearing off at 2-12 Newberry.

242
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,514
Speaker 0: >> It's clearing out at 2-12 Newberry.

243
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:23,288
Speaker 0: >> You got a

244
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:46,225
Speaker 0: $1.89? >>

245
00:40:46,225 --> 00:40:46,880
Speaker 0: You want a new gun?

246
00:40:46,880 --> 00:41:28,179
Speaker 0: >> When he comes out, y'all don't run up on me with a baton.

247
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:31,839
Speaker 0: >> Put a gun in the hand of the guy.

248
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:36,493
Speaker 0: >> I'm always sober.

249
00:41:36,734 --> 00:41:38,300
Speaker 0: I've been again for a while.

250
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:45,120
Speaker 0: >> Alright, 5-0-1 Boylston coming in now.

251
00:41:45,821 --> 00:41:47,680
Speaker 0: They're trying to break in the glass doors there.

252
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:54,980
Speaker 0: >> Hey, I'm stealing some of you guys to go with the captain.

253
00:41:56,422 --> 00:41:59,060
Speaker 0: I'm stealing some of you guys to go with the captain for the super.

254
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,000
Speaker 0: >> Hey, guys.

255
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,998
Speaker 0: >> Obviously, everybody's got to stay together.

256
00:42:04,998 --> 00:42:44,280
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, they should hire more cops.

257
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:56,765
Speaker 0: >> What is that for?

258
00:42:56,765 --> 00:43:20,526
Speaker 0: >> I don't know.

259
00:43:20,526 --> 00:44:37,645
Speaker 0: >> Hey, I caught the large group in the sun market.

260
00:44:37,766 --> 00:44:38,370
Speaker 0: Now, is that correct?

261
00:44:38,370 --> 00:45:41,377
Speaker 0: >> Delta Base, can you give me UPD?

262
00:45:42,223 --> 00:45:44,359
Speaker 0: Two hard toes over the massive Harrison in the NBA.

263
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:58,790
Speaker 0: >> You leave it on the whole fucking time.

264
00:45:59,774 --> 00:46:00,989
Speaker 0: You leave it on the whole time.

265
00:46:00,989 --> 00:46:01,502
Speaker 0: >> Oh, no, no.

266
00:46:01,502 --> 00:46:04,526
Speaker 0: >> Oh, yeah.

267
00:46:04,526 --> 00:46:05,332
Speaker 0: >> Negative.

268
00:46:05,332 --> 00:48:14,413
Speaker 0: >> Alpha

00:48:14,413 --> 00:48:15,740
Speaker 0: 3. >>

270
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:16,442
Speaker 0: We have that.

271
00:48:16,482 --> 00:48:16,904
Speaker 0: Thank you.

272
00:48:16,904 --> 00:48:30,000
Speaker 0: >> Kilo 102 up to ring road.

273
00:48:30,000 --> 00:49:01,990
Speaker 0: >> Ring road at 6.

00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:02,611
Speaker 0: One coming out the door now.

275
00:49:02,611 --> 00:50:46,459
Speaker 0: >> 240 Newbury is a CVS.

276
00:50:46,479 --> 00:50:48,730
Speaker 0: They're trying to smash the doors now with a baseball bat.

277
00:50:48,730 --> 00:51:04,364
Speaker 0: >> Five, nine, nine.

278
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:29,607
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, I got it.

00:52:21,821 --> 00:52:29,900
Speaker 0: >> What do you got going there?

283
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:34,139
Speaker 0: >> They're still looted in the building.

284
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:36,360
Speaker 0: >> Okay.

285
00:52:36,360 --> 00:53:03,526
Speaker 0: >> Are you in the building?

00:53:06,607 --> 00:53:07,378
Speaker 0: Me and five other officers.

Speaker 0: I got a group of 50 in there.

292
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:40,430

Speaker 0: >> Yes, sir.

294
00:53:42,909 --> 00:53:46,037
Speaker 0: >> Okay, I don't want you guys to get caught up in this.

295
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:50,290
Speaker 0: Let's make your way out to ring road and just have a line right there outside the door.

00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:53,425
Speaker 0: >> I have it.

Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

306
00:56:28,158 --> 00:56:38,351
Speaker 0: >> Did you hear some lady like driving by when we were walking away?

307
00:56:38,892 --> 00:56:40,557
Speaker 0: She like rolled her window down.

308
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:43,739
Speaker 0: She's like... >> They're looting whatever address.

309
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:44,539
Speaker 0: >> You don't say.

310
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:47,240
Speaker 0: >> I go, yeah, maybe they should have hired more cops.

311
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,355
Speaker 0: >> What do you want?

312
00:56:49,355 --> 00:56:57,140
Speaker 0: >> These guys?

313
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:57,612
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

314
00:56:57,612 --> 00:57:01,120
Speaker 0: >> We're all working at this time, but I can certainly make some phone calls.

315
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:07,637
Speaker 0: >> That's

316
00:57:07,637 --> 00:57:50,994
Speaker 0: 12. >>

317
00:57:50,994 --> 00:57:51,945
Speaker 0: You got any glue?

318
00:57:51,945 --> 00:58:13,410
Speaker 0: >> Why do they break into some places and not others, like that Zara?

319
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:14,119
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

320
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:16,863
Speaker 0: >> I don't think anybody even shops there.

321
00:58:17,084 --> 00:58:18,150
Speaker 0: It's like European people.

322
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:19,069
Speaker 0: >> Which store, sir?

323
00:58:19,069 --> 00:58:25,294
Speaker 0: >> Oh, I thought he was chasing that car.

324
00:58:25,294 --> 00:59:11,457
Speaker 0: >> Matt, take a squad down there.

325
00:59:11,477 --> 00:59:12,860
Speaker 0: Just look out for the Leonard.

326
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:15,538
Speaker 0: >> Got it.

327
00:59:15,538 --> 00:59:20,642
Speaker 0: >> And have the D14 cop hang around.

328
00:59:20,662 --> 00:59:22,070
Speaker 0: We can put it in the lot right here.

329
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:36,050
Speaker 0: >> I didn't even notice.

330
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:38,388
Speaker 0: >> Delta 908, I'm taking a squad to Boyle Center and Exeter.

331
00:59:38,388 --> 00:59:39,630
Speaker 0: >> Oh, yeah.

332
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:41,865
Speaker 0: >> He's like, "Leave me

333
00:59:41,885 --> 00:59:42,046
Speaker 0: alone.".

334
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:58,420

01:27:16,279 --> 01:27:18,470
Speaker 0: >> He owns the smoke shop.

502
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:22,670
Speaker 0: >> Was it water, at least?

503
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:24,210
Speaker 0: >> No, it wasn't that.

504
01:27:24,210 --> 01:27:24,990
Speaker 0: >> It was water.

505
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:26,470
Speaker 0: >> It's sealed, so... >> Yeah.

506
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:43,939
Speaker 0: [radio chatter] [horn honks].

507
01:27:43,939 --> 01:27:53,639
Speaker 0: >> I said the captain's that boss on that trip.

508
01:27:56,253 --> 01:27:56,540
Speaker 0: [horn honks].

509
01:27:56,540 --> 01:28:03,600
Speaker 0: >> They even took the license plate off the van.

510
01:28:05,445 --> 01:28:05,859
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

511
01:28:05,859 --> 01:28:18,337
Speaker 0: >> Captain, we're at Berkeley right now.

512
01:28:19,221 --> 01:28:20,199
Speaker 0: Between Berkeley and Arlington.

513
01:28:20,199 --> 01:28:22,398
Speaker 0: >> I have it.

514
01:28:22,398 --> 01:29:17,298
Speaker 0: >> Brian McGrail, your location?

515
01:29:17,298 --> 01:29:28,678
Speaker 0: >> 211 Newberry, Delta

516
01:29:28,678 --> 01:29:34,205
Speaker 0: 903. >>

517
01:29:34,205 --> 01:29:34,967
Speaker 0: It came over?

518
01:29:34,967 --> 01:29:39,900
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

519
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:42,370
Speaker 0: >> Delta 903, 211 Newberry.

520
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:46,939
Speaker 0: >> Guys, one sec.

521
01:29:46,939 --> 01:29:49,020
Speaker 0: >> You got anything going on there right now?

522
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:53,479
Speaker 0: >> It's just like, uh... >> Yeah, Berlin people along.

523
01:29:54,181 --> 01:29:55,839
Speaker 0: As we walk, they come out of this door to move.

524
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:58,779
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

525
01:29:58,779 --> 01:30:02,719
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, we can do that.

526
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:06,019
Speaker 0: >> Brian, do that for me.

527
01:30:07,386 --> 01:30:07,960
Speaker 0: See what you got.

528
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:13,540
Speaker 0: >> Captain, he's like... Uh, do you want to head over to the Copley Square Mall?

529
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:14,319
Speaker 0: >> Absolutely.

530
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:14,779
Speaker 0: >> All right.

531
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:27,775
Speaker 0: [radio chatter] [laughter].

532
01:30:27,775 --> 01:31:23,850
Speaker 0: >> It's a new CSO van, too, huh?

533
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:25,130
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, of course.

534
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:25,838
Speaker 0: 2200 miles.

535
01:31:25,838 --> 01:31:30,009
Speaker 0: >> Probably get a new one in four years.

536
01:31:30,009 --> 01:31:31,708
Speaker 0: >> What's up?

537
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:33,628
Speaker 0: Hold on.

538
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:35,729
Speaker 0: What's that?

539
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:40,099
Speaker 0: Cull?

540
01:31:40,099 --> 01:31:42,879
Speaker 0: >> Okay.

541
01:31:42,879 --> 01:31:46,485
Speaker 0: >> Oh.

542
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,960
Speaker 0: No, one of the B2B guys is standing in front of us.

543
01:31:57,202 --> 01:31:57,579
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

544
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:25,539
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

545
01:32:25,539 --> 01:32:29,910
Speaker 0: >> Oh, you're the fucking boss.

546
01:32:31,193 --> 01:32:32,650
Speaker 0: Is that somebody's duty bag?

547
01:32:37,192 --> 01:32:37,730
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

548
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:42,140
Speaker 0: >> I can take that out of the back of the van?

549
01:32:46,896 --> 01:32:48,129
Speaker 0: Hope we didn't have anything crazy in there.

550
01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:50,189
Speaker 0: >> Where's the van now?

551
01:32:50,189 --> 01:32:51,370
Speaker 0: >> Right back here.

552
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:53,070
Speaker 0: No, I'll take it back over, I guess.

553
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:54,029
Speaker 0: >> This one?

554
01:32:54,029 --> 01:32:54,666
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

555
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:20,112
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

556
01:33:20,112 --> 01:33:23,140
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

557
01:33:24,703 --> 01:33:26,499
Speaker 0: Hey, you said to the Copley Square Park?

558
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:34,902
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

559
01:33:34,902 --> 01:33:59,540
Speaker 0: >> Guys, watch these vehicles.

560
01:35:04,481 --> 01:35:04,879
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

561
01:35:04,879 --> 01:35:06,100
Speaker 0: >> What's the location for the RITO again?

562
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:12,180
Speaker 0: >> Berkeley and Newberry.

563
01:35:12,321 --> 01:35:13,060
Speaker 0: Berkeley and Newberry.

564
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:15,939
Speaker 0: >> Okay, I have that.

565
01:35:15,939 --> 01:35:18,441
Speaker 0: >> Mansion, Newberry.

566
01:35:18,441 --> 01:36:10,819
Speaker 0: >> Deploy back down.

567
01:36:10,819 --> 01:36:15,020
Speaker 0: >> Just have presence up there.

568
01:36:15,383 --> 01:36:16,579
Speaker 0: Should keep them out of there, yeah?

569
01:36:16,579 --> 01:36:20,060
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, I got a group coming in from Brookline as well.

570
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:21,200
Speaker 0: They're staging Mansion, Newberry.

571
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:25,279
Speaker 0: >> All right, link on here first.

572
01:36:25,622 --> 01:36:26,820
Speaker 0: So I sent them up there.

573
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:30,540
Speaker 0: >> Okay, do you need help down where you are?

574
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:31,500
Speaker 0: >> Get him, get him, get him!

575
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:39,639
Speaker 0: >> Send Brookline down, I like... Send them to the captain off Boylston Street.

576
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:40,940
Speaker 0: Boylston and Ring Road then.

577
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:42,579
Speaker 0: >> Okay, will do.

578
01:36:42,579 --> 01:36:52,813
Speaker 0: >> Delta Base, Delta 910.

579
01:36:52,813 --> 01:36:54,290
Speaker 0: D and G, tone on the way.

580
01:36:55,812 --> 01:36:57,630
Speaker 0: Okay, there's two officers standing by there now.

581
01:36:58,055 --> 01:36:58,328
Speaker 0: Thank you.

582
01:36:58,328 --> 01:37:05,320
Speaker 0: >> I'm just going to head up to the stacks.

583
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:34,380
Speaker 0: >> Not sure if it's already on the board, but we just got a call about North Face on Newberry Street being loaded.

584
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:41,180
Speaker 0: >> Multiple alarm calls on loading up and down Newberry.

585
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:46,263
Speaker 0: >> Vehicles here.

586
01:37:57,951 --> 01:38:01,526
Speaker 0: We won't let any traffic say Berkeley and Newberry.

587
01:38:03,697 --> 01:38:04,570
Speaker 0: We'll shut it down there.

588
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:06,069
Speaker 0: We won't let anybody up.

589
01:38:06,069 --> 01:38:10,950
Speaker 0: >> We're going to close off Newberry altogether at Berkeley Street.

590
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:55,104
Speaker 0: >> Desi, wait up.

591
01:38:55,104 --> 01:39:45,077
Speaker 0: >> Hey, this is the whole mall, right?

592
01:39:45,077 --> 01:39:46,300
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, where you guys trying to go?

593
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:47,079
Speaker 0: >> Anywhere.

594
01:39:47,079 --> 01:39:49,140
Speaker 0: >> Boylston Street?

595
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:52,040
Speaker 0: >> We just want to walk through and see if we can find anybody.

596
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:54,014
Speaker 0: >> We got it pretty tight in here.

597
01:39:54,035 --> 01:39:54,720
Speaker 0: Nobody's coming in here.

598
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,958
Speaker 0: >> This one particular spot, though, right?

599
01:39:56,958 --> 01:39:57,900
Speaker 0: >> This whole mall.

600
01:39:58,421 --> 01:40:00,400
Speaker 0: We got about 15 guys inside here.

601
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:00,780
Speaker 0: >> Okay.

602
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:03,500
Speaker 0: >> They did hit Lord and Taylor's and Shaw's.

603
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:04,559
Speaker 0: They've been hitting Starr.

604
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:05,480
Speaker 0: They've been going in and out.

605
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,060
Speaker 0: >> All right, so otherwise you guys are secure.

606
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:07,655
Speaker 0: >> This is tight.

607
01:40:08,041 --> 01:40:08,940
Speaker 0: We got a lot of people in here.

608
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:09,419
Speaker 0: >> All right.

609
01:40:09,419 --> 01:40:10,499
Speaker 0: >> They've been staying out.

610
01:40:10,499 --> 01:41:13,300
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, it's the whole fucking street, Steve.

611
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:35,447
Speaker 0: [wind blowing].

612
01:41:35,447 --> 01:42:06,282
Speaker 0: >> Hands behind your back.

613
01:42:31,313 --> 01:42:32,249
Speaker 0: Hands behind your back.

614
01:42:32,249 --> 01:42:43,038
Speaker 0: >> No.

615
01:42:43,038 --> 01:42:52,730
Speaker 0: >> Just sit down.

616
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:53,750
Speaker 0: >> Can I turn around a little bit, please?

617
01:42:59,510 --> 01:43:23,777
Speaker 0: [beeping] >> Let's get you set up, all right?

618
01:43:23,777 --> 01:43:26,543
Speaker 0: >> Good job.

619
01:43:33,263 --> 01:43:34,520
Speaker 0: All right, I'm going to head down to the fourth side.

620
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:35,011
Speaker 0: >> Okay.

621
01:43:35,011 --> 01:43:37,817
Speaker 0: >> What do you guys want to do with this guy?

622
01:43:37,817 --> 01:43:39,960
Speaker 0: >> What are we doing with this guy?

623
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:44,720
Speaker 0: >> You can't say what we're doing.

624
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:45,011
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

625
01:43:45,011 --> 01:43:48,939
Speaker 0: >> Tell me what you want.

626
01:43:48,939 --> 01:43:52,186
Speaker 0: >> What's your record looking like?

627
01:43:52,186 --> 01:43:59,358
Speaker 0: >> All right.

628
01:43:59,358 --> 01:44:07,005
Speaker 0: >> This is not bad.

629
01:44:09,010 --> 01:44:09,448
Speaker 0: How many guns?

630
01:44:09,448 --> 01:44:14,700
Speaker 0: >> I just caught one last few months ago, but I can do this.

631
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:16,296
Speaker 0: >> What do you think this is?

632
01:44:19,084 --> 01:44:20,240
Speaker 0: I'll take it, Brian.

633
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:21,620
Speaker 0: >> All right.

634
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:30,300
Speaker 0: >> I'll charge him with domestic terrorism.

635
01:44:30,300 --> 01:45:05,956
Speaker 0: >> Who is this?

636
01:45:05,956 --> 01:45:13,500
Speaker 0: >> Huh?

637
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:14,440
Speaker 0: >> Who's Elmita?

638
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:15,739
Speaker 0: >> He walked out.

639
01:45:21,874 --> 01:45:22,146
Speaker 0: [beeping].

640
01:45:22,146 --> 01:45:35,865
Speaker 0: >> All right, so we can shut it down at Diamond and St.

641
01:45:35,905 --> 01:45:42,390
Speaker 0: James and keep it from coming up to Boyle to Donover?

642
01:45:42,390 --> 01:45:43,346
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, yeah.

643
01:45:43,346 --> 01:45:51,030
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, we want to form a perimeter around this entire area for vehicle traffic.

644
01:45:51,030 --> 01:45:56,560
Speaker 0: >> A perimeter to exclude vehicle traffic.

645
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:57,490
Speaker 0: >> Okay.

646
01:46:00,067 --> 01:46:00,379
Speaker 0: What's up?

647
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:07,140
Speaker 0: Looting, trespassing, breaking and entering at night, domestic terrorism, inciting a riot.

648
01:46:07,140 --> 01:46:08,620
Speaker 0: >> What he's doing is being charged with.

649
01:46:08,620 --> 01:46:09,518
Speaker 0: >> All right, calm down.

650
01:46:09,518 --> 01:46:10,859
Speaker 0: >> What's he doing?

651
01:46:10,859 --> 01:46:12,943
Speaker 0: >> District 4.

652
01:46:12,943 --> 01:46:13,980
Speaker 0: Unless they're taking him, Brian.

653
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:46,088
Speaker 0: >> Do you want this or no?

654
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:00,299
Speaker 0: Because we can just cut him in half.

655
01:47:00,299 --> 01:47:03,099
Speaker 0: >> I mean, it's the fucking city's on fire, so.

656
01:47:03,099 --> 01:47:05,619
Speaker 0: >> I'll summon someone.

657
01:47:05,619 --> 01:47:06,340
Speaker 0: >> Okay.

658
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:06,800
Speaker 0: >> Listen.

659
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:09,360
Speaker 0: >> Who's your brother?

660
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:10,998
Speaker 0: >> Oh, no.

661
01:47:10,998 --> 01:47:12,440
Speaker 0: >> Okay, you got a phone on you?

662
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:13,999
Speaker 0: >> No, I don't know.

663
01:47:13,999 --> 01:47:14,536
Speaker 0: >> This is it.

664
01:47:14,536 --> 01:47:15,919
Speaker 0: >> We're going to take him in.

665
01:47:15,919 --> 01:47:18,179
Speaker 0: >> We're going to release you.

666
01:47:18,179 --> 01:47:18,940

Speaker 0: I saw the whole thing from the beginning.

Speaker 0: >> Uh, they stole them all out of our van.

709
01:49:09,363 --> 01:49:11,380

Speaker 0: >> Nice.

715
01:49:23,654 --> 01:49:25,380
Speaker 0: >> I used to live in Miami.

716
01:49:26,862 --> 01:49:30,020
Speaker 0: It's a long story, but my friend in Ohio said you'd better get one.

717
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:33,032
Speaker 0: One of my students came in and tried to rob me.

718
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:37,133
Speaker 0: I sat there with my gun and said, "You come in this

719
01:49:37,153 --> 01:49:37,697
Speaker 0: apartment.".

720
01:49:37,697 --> 01:49:39,000

01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:39,340
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

722
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:41,980

01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:49,820
Speaker 0: >> I'm just going to bring it back in the slot.

724
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:55,636
Speaker 0: >> It's like 60 wretches in the apartment.

725
01:49:55,636 --> 01:50:10,532
Speaker 0: >> I apologize.

726
01:50:10,532 --> 01:50:15,040
Speaker 0: >> Why don't you go smash up some windows and loot around Roxbury?

727
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,798
Speaker 0: >> Hey, go home.

728
01:50:15,798 --> 01:50:16,555

Speaker 0: >> No, you're not writing it.

734
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:43,319
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

735
01:50:43,319 --> 01:50:50,738
Speaker 0: >> Well, when he zigged, I was like, "I'm going to get this

736
01:50:50,798 --> 01:50:51,360
Speaker 0: motherfucker.".

737
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:57,357
Speaker 0: >> Watch your feet, man.

Speaker 0: >> You don't want it?

740
01:51:02,659 --> 01:51:04,340
Speaker 0: >> You can take it if you want.

741
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:16,835
Speaker 0: >> All right, no pedestrians, no cars on Newbury unless they live there.

742

Speaker 0: [phone ringing].

744
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:33,512
Speaker 0: >> Your deal is.

745
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:34,860
Speaker 0: none of this is without my hand.

746
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:36,426

Speaker 0: >> No.

904
02:01:55,911 --> 02:01:57,259
Speaker 0: >> That's my property.

905
02:01:57,259 --> 02:01:59,980
Speaker 0: >> This is somebody else's property.

906
02:02:00,142 --> 02:02:00,759
Speaker 0: This isn't your property.

907
02:02:02,947 --> 02:02:04,560
Speaker 0: He respects people's property, right?

02:02:05,146 --> 02:02:05,397
Speaker 0: Looting.

909
02:02:06,887 --> 02:02:07,820

Speaker 0: >> Why, is there somebody in there?

914
02:03:18,118 --> 02:03:21,540
Speaker 0: >> Well, I couldn't get the doors open, so there could be.

915
02:03:21,540 --> 02:03:26,120
Speaker 0: >> They're probably on somebody's key chain.

Speaker 0: [phone ringing].

917
02:03:31,540 --> 02:03:40,120

Speaker 0: >> Did this guy get patted down?

933
02:04:18,270 --> 02:04:19,409

1266
02:30:42,039 --> 02:30:42,720
Speaker 0: >> I'll book it right.

1267
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:44,280

1273
02:30:49,245 --> 02:30:51,659
Speaker 0: these fucking people were found inside Lord and Taylor's.

1274
02:30:51,659 --> 02:30:52,859
Speaker 0: >> Actually, with a mass arrest.

1275
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:54,580
Speaker 0: Isn't a supervisor supposed to write it?

1276
02:30:54,580 --> 02:30:55,960
Speaker 0: >> I don't know.

1277
02:30:56,081 --> 02:30:56,617
Speaker 0: We go find the captain.

1278
02:30:56,617 --> 02:30:57,199
Speaker 0: >> Mass arrest.

1279
02:30:57,400 --> 02:30:58,679
Speaker 0: I think supervisor's not supposed to write it.

1280
02:30:58,679 --> 02:31:11,480
Speaker 0: >> The kid that went down the wrong way and came back, I knew I really had to go down there, so that door was fucking closed.

1281
02:31:11,882 --> 02:31:13,120
Speaker 0: So I just kept coming full speed.

1282
02:31:14,300 --> 02:31:17,620
Speaker 0: Like, as long as Taylor unblocked, I just fucking hammered the fuck out of him.

1283
02:31:17,620 --> 02:31:20,118
Speaker 0: >> Dude, I've never seen anything like this in 10 years.

1284

02:31:25,240 --> 02:31:26,040
Speaker 0: Like, people running.

1286
02:31:29,165 --> 02:31:30,260
Speaker 0: That was wild, dude.

1287
02:31:30,260 --> 02:31:34,818
Speaker 0: >> The commissioner, the mayor, and the--.

1288
02:31:34,818 --> 02:31:36,980
Speaker 0: >> They're going to say it was a peaceful protest.

1289
02:31:36,980 --> 02:31:39,479
Speaker 0: >> It's fucking crazy, dude.

1294
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:05,320
Speaker 0: 'Cause I don't have any cuffs.

1295
02:32:05,320 --> 02:32:08,880
Speaker 0: >> I got one set of cuffs that are as easy, so I don't mind if I lose 'em.

1296
02:32:08,880 --> 02:33:25,280
Speaker 0: >> Where's McGrail?

1297
02:33:25,280 --> 02:34:01,910
Speaker 0: >> You guys want water?

1298
02:34:01,910 --> 02:34:03,629
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, a case of water, man.

1299
02:34:03,629 --> 02:34:08,309
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, grab me one, Billy.

1300
02:34:08,309 --> 02:34:08,790
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1301
02:34:08,790 --> 02:34:12,650
Speaker 0: >> He ain't down here.

1302
02:34:12,650 --> 02:34:14,270
Speaker 0: >> McGrail walked down here.

1303
02:34:14,713 --> 02:34:15,728
Speaker 0: He said to continue on.

1304
02:34:16,710 --> 02:34:17,750
Speaker 0: McGrail's a fast walker.

1305
02:34:20,477 --> 02:34:21,510
Speaker 0: I thought we were following you guys.

1306
02:34:21,590 --> 02:34:22,409
Speaker 0: I thought you guys were following him.

1307
02:34:43,634 --> 02:34:44,950
Speaker 0: You guys working the first half already?

1308
02:34:44,950 --> 02:34:47,049
Speaker 0: >> Going up.

Speaker 0: Hazlitt's on 7.

1312
02:35:16,023 --> 02:35:16,659
Speaker 0: Oh, thank you, man.

1313
02:35:16,659 --> 02:35:24,794
Speaker 0: >> Hey.

1314
02:35:24,794 --> 02:35:38,880
Speaker 0: >> We thought you already walked off, so we're a little further down by the parking garage entrance where the troopers' cars are parked.

1315
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:42,497
Speaker 0: >> We'll wait here.

1316
02:35:42,497 --> 02:35:43,920
Speaker 0: >> I have a wagon coming for you.

1317
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:46,897
Speaker 0: >> Where's he at?

1318
02:35:46,897 --> 02:35:48,300
Speaker 0: >> He's up there.

1319
02:35:48,906 --> 02:35:49,740

Speaker 0: >> I'll have to kiss if I have one.

1332
02:36:41,250 --> 02:36:42,310
Speaker 0: >> Okay, very good.

1333
02:36:42,310 --> 02:36:53,270
Speaker 0: >> Fuckin' beat.

1334
02:36:55,254 --> 02:36:55,867
Speaker 0: [horn honks].

1335
02:37:35,940 --> 02:37:36,540
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

1336
02:37:36,540 --> 02:39:33,930
Speaker 0: >> 'Cause the state police was supposed to be up there with a squad.

1337
02:39:33,930 --> 02:39:38,939
Speaker 0: >> Okay, I don't see anybody there.

1338
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:40,859
Speaker 0: We got traffic coming up on Boylston.

1339
02:39:40,859 --> 02:39:44,460
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, you see four?

1340
02:39:44,460 --> 02:39:45,580
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, you see four?

1341
02:39:45,580 --> 02:39:48,660
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, I got a couple of Chelsea officers here.

1342
02:39:48,923 --> 02:39:49,340
Speaker 0: [horn honks].

1343
02:39:49,340 --> 02:39:54,397
Speaker 0: >> They'll check and see if there's another street open head over.

1344
02:39:54,397 --> 02:40:02,519
Speaker 0: >> Super, if they can block the traffic coming up on Boylston, that'd be great.

1345
02:40:02,519 --> 02:40:03,514
Speaker 0: >> Get out.

1346
02:40:04,426 --> 02:40:05,317
Speaker 0: You're so stupid doing that.

1347
02:40:05,317 --> 02:40:08,019
Speaker 0: >> Block traffic coming up on Boylston from Dalton.

1348
02:40:08,019 --> 02:40:16,118
Speaker 0: >> What are we doing?

1349
02:40:18,083 --> 02:40:20,920
Speaker 0: Waiting for the captain to tell me what the hell he wanted, and then he just bonded off.

1350
02:40:23,200 --> 02:40:23,558
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

1351
02:40:23,558 --> 02:40:32,340
Speaker 0: >> Was yours the one they were talking about?

1352
02:40:32,340 --> 02:40:32,713
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, sir.

1353
02:40:34,440 --> 02:40:35,240
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

1354
02:40:35,240 --> 02:40:35,960
Speaker 0: >> There's no need to be.

1355
02:40:37,243 --> 02:40:37,618
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

1356
02:40:37,618 --> 02:40:41,700
Speaker 0: >> You see the cruiser in the alley?

1357
02:40:42,325 --> 02:40:43,380
Speaker 0: That was your cruiser, right?

1358
02:40:43,380 --> 02:40:44,519
Speaker 0: >> Jesus.

1359
02:40:57,181 --> 02:41:00,280
Speaker 0: [radio chatter] [laughter].

1360
02:41:00,280 --> 02:41:11,794
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, what the fuck?

1361
02:41:15,324 --> 02:41:15,859
Speaker 0: This is wild.

1362
02:41:15,859 --> 02:41:16,296
Speaker 0: >> Say it again.

1363
02:41:16,296 --> 02:41:18,540
Speaker 0: >> This is fucking wild.

1364
02:41:19,221 --> 02:41:27,700
Speaker 0: We're fucking inside sacks, and we're fighting with two of them, and then more of them start breaking in the fucking place.

1365
02:41:28,162 --> 02:41:29,460
Speaker 0: They're running around the upstairs.

1366
02:41:30,781 --> 02:41:31,460
Speaker 0: It's insane.

1367
02:41:31,801 --> 02:41:32,940
Speaker 0: It's like a fucking war zone.

1368
02:41:32,940 --> 02:41:33,331
Speaker 0: >> Yes.

1369
02:41:34,243 --> 02:41:35,019
Speaker 0: Five of the summits.

1370
02:41:35,019 --> 02:41:42,569
Speaker 0: >> One of the kids ran out, and he jumped off the side.

1371
02:41:42,569 --> 02:41:46,950
Speaker 0: >> As patrolmen, we were just wondering, isn't a supervisor supposed to write mass arrests?

1372
02:41:46,950 --> 02:41:49,270
Speaker 0: >> That's why I came today.

1373
02:41:49,770 --> 02:41:52,609
Speaker 0: [laughter] >> Just, you know, just trying to throw a little--.

1374
02:41:52,609 --> 02:41:55,230
Speaker 0: >> This is not a mass arrest.

1375
02:41:55,410 --> 02:41:57,310
Speaker 0: They're all separate 1-1s, so enjoy.

1376
02:41:57,310 --> 02:42:00,543
Speaker 0: >> Oh, this is a 1-1-1, right?

1377
02:42:00,543 --> 02:42:04,262
Speaker 0: >> I've got to say, none of that-- Hey, that was my knee.

1378
02:42:05,070 --> 02:42:07,890
Speaker 0: I was getting ready to go outside with my knee right now, so he said separate 1 with my knee.

1379
02:42:07,890 --> 02:42:22,068
Speaker 0: >> Fucking back is on fire.

1380
02:42:22,068 --> 02:42:55,288
Speaker 0: >> Only guy making sense this evening.

1381
02:42:57,616 --> 02:42:58,610
Speaker 0: Only guy making sense.

1382
02:42:58,670 --> 02:42:59,907
Speaker 0: The only guy making sense this evening.

1383
02:42:59,907 --> 02:43:13,599
Speaker 0: >> You guys got guys from crack scene out here filming everything, too?

1384
02:43:13,599 --> 02:43:14,057
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

1385
02:43:14,057 --> 02:43:17,320
Speaker 0: >> I've had this thing on the whole fucking time.

1386
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:17,959
Speaker 0: >> You have, yeah.

1387
02:43:17,959 --> 02:43:18,780
Speaker 0: >> Wouldn't they--.

1388
02:43:18,780 --> 02:43:19,380
Speaker 0: >> Since they--.

1389
02:43:19,380 --> 02:43:20,520
Speaker 0: >> It hasn't run out of battery?

1390
02:43:20,520 --> 02:43:23,076
Speaker 0: >> No, I think we get 16 hours.

1391
02:43:23,076 --> 02:43:25,099
Speaker 0: >> I don't think that one.

1392
02:43:27,283 --> 02:43:31,539
Speaker 0: It seems to not affect the battery, whether it's recording or not.

1393
02:43:32,221 --> 02:43:40,940
Speaker 0: Because yesterday-- Not yesterday, I banged in, but Friday, I had a four-hour recording because they rioted over at the station.

1394
02:43:41,703 --> 02:43:43,774
Speaker 0: And the battery was still at, like, 47% or something.

1395
02:43:43,774 --> 02:43:45,801
Speaker 0: >> All right.

1396
02:43:45,801 --> 02:44:11,960
Speaker 0: >> Everyone down there, I guess.

1397
02:44:11,960 --> 02:44:16,780
Speaker 0: >> It's good for shit like this.

1398
02:44:16,780 --> 02:44:33,449
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, I'm saying that's like a fucking 200-voice.

1399
02:44:39,171 --> 02:44:39,749
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

1400
02:44:39,749 --> 02:44:46,217
Speaker 0: >> Is looting a charge?

1401
02:44:46,217 --> 02:44:50,290
Speaker 0: >> Is looting a charge?

1402
02:44:50,290 --> 02:44:53,750
Speaker 0: >> I would, like, trespass--.

1403
02:44:53,750 --> 02:44:54,486
Speaker 0: >> Disorderly.

1404
02:44:54,486 --> 02:44:55,609
Speaker 0: >> Disorderly.

1405
02:44:56,751 --> 02:44:57,269
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

1406
02:44:57,269 --> 02:45:00,093
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, I'll take one, thanks.

1407
02:45:00,093 --> 02:45:05,415
Speaker 0: >> Thank you.

1408
02:45:05,415 --> 02:45:10,246
Speaker 0: >> Thank you.

1409
02:45:10,246 --> 02:45:17,419
Speaker 0: >> Put it together for you.

1410
02:45:17,419 --> 02:45:31,780
Speaker 0: >> Delta Charlie

1411
02:45:31,780 --> 02:45:33,615
Speaker 0: 1. >>

1412
02:45:33,615 --> 02:45:33,980
Speaker 0: Charlie

1413
02:45:33,980 --> 02:45:42,022
Speaker 0: 1. >>

1414
02:45:42,022 --> 02:45:43,016
Speaker 0: Delta Charlie 1, you calling?

1415
02:45:43,016 --> 02:45:46,620
Speaker 0: >> Why is this idiot so soft there?

1416
02:45:46,620 --> 02:46:11,330
Speaker 0: >> Belmont?

1417
02:46:11,330 --> 02:46:12,590
Speaker 0: >> Like, what the fuck?

1418
02:46:39,670 --> 02:46:41,559
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

1419
02:46:41,559 --> 02:46:55,110
Speaker 0: >> Okay, everybody's heading up the Newberry Street.

1420
02:46:55,110 --> 02:46:58,090
Speaker 0: >> Is that good?

1421
02:46:58,090 --> 02:47:00,150
Speaker 0: >> We can go get another five.

1422
02:47:00,150 --> 02:47:04,311
Speaker 0: >> Out.

1423
02:47:04,311 --> 02:47:37,798
Speaker 0: >> I didn't think to grab him when he left.

1424
02:47:37,798 --> 02:47:52,440
Speaker 0: >> Thanks, man.

1425
02:47:52,440 --> 02:48:02,405
Speaker 0: >> We'll try to raise them on you.

1426
02:48:09,510 --> 02:48:10,350
Speaker 0: They may be on one.

1427
02:48:10,350 --> 02:48:13,049
Speaker 0: >> Where are you right now?

1428
02:48:13,252 --> 02:48:14,328
Speaker 0: We'll meet up with you or another location.

1429
02:48:14,328 --> 02:49:03,548
Speaker 0: >> Awesome, thank you.

1430
02:49:03,548 --> 02:49:26,270
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

1431
02:49:26,270 --> 02:49:42,850
Speaker 0: >> These guys still haven't finished.

1432
02:49:42,850 --> 02:49:43,084
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

1433
02:49:43,084 --> 02:49:45,227
Speaker 0: >> You guys want to cross?

1434
02:49:45,227 --> 02:49:46,530
Speaker 0: >> If you want to do such.

1435
02:49:46,530 --> 02:50:15,963
Speaker 0: >> Hey, buddy.

1436
02:50:15,963 --> 02:50:28,208
Speaker 0: >> You got me.

1437
02:50:28,208 --> 02:50:29,308
Speaker 0: >> Hey!

1438
02:50:29,308 --> 02:50:30,850
Speaker 0: >> Did you have fun?

1439
02:50:30,850 --> 02:50:32,150
Speaker 0: >> What's up, sweetie?

1440
02:50:32,150 --> 02:50:34,329
Speaker 0: >> This is, like, fucking insane, dude.

1441
02:50:35,211 --> 02:50:38,430
Speaker 0: We were just chasing them all around inside of Saks Fifth Avenue.

1442
02:50:39,032 --> 02:50:40,889
Speaker 0: As we're locking them up, there's more coming in.

1443
02:50:42,130 --> 02:50:43,310
Speaker 0: Fucking... >> How many did you arrest so far?

1444
02:50:43,310 --> 02:50:43,985
Speaker 0: >> Six.

1445
02:50:43,985 --> 02:50:44,809
Speaker 0: >> Jesus.

1446
02:50:46,031 --> 02:50:47,470
Speaker 0: Did anybody try to fight you guys up at all?

1447
02:50:47,470 --> 02:50:50,090
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, they were whipping fucking bottles.

1448
02:50:50,891 --> 02:50:52,348
Speaker 0: The guys downtown got fucked.

1449
02:50:52,348 --> 02:50:52,809
Speaker 0: >> Thank you.

1450
02:50:52,809 --> 02:50:54,529
Speaker 0: >> They got hit hard downtown.

1451
02:50:54,529 --> 02:50:55,680
Speaker 0: >> Oh, yeah?

1452
02:50:57,013 --> 02:50:58,050
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, we were just close up.

1453
02:50:58,090 --> 02:51:01,069
Speaker 0: We got guys all down the street, but there's guys, Adidas is all blown out and everything else.

1454
02:51:01,333 --> 02:51:02,449
Speaker 0: You should see our cruiser.

1455
02:51:02,912 --> 02:51:04,169
Speaker 0: They smashed it right in front of us.

1456
02:51:04,630 --> 02:51:07,270
Speaker 0: And then they fucking broke into a place and lit it on fire.

1457
02:51:07,851 --> 02:51:08,248
Speaker 0: It's a store.

1458
02:51:09,470 --> 02:51:10,810
Speaker 0: It's a Zara store.

1459
02:51:11,230 --> 02:51:13,750
Speaker 0: It sells clothes for, like, fucking European men.

1460
02:51:13,750 --> 02:51:14,508
Speaker 0: >> That's crazy.

1461
02:51:14,508 --> 02:51:15,950
Speaker 0: >> All right.

1462
02:51:16,011 --> 02:51:17,110
Speaker 0: I got to go catch up with them.

1463
02:51:17,110 --> 02:51:17,703
Speaker 0: >> All right, brother.

1464
02:51:17,724 --> 02:51:17,910
Speaker 0: Be safe.

1465
02:51:17,910 --> 02:51:18,790
Speaker 0: >> Probably see you around.

1466
02:51:18,790 --> 02:51:19,620
Speaker 0: >> All right, brother.

1467
02:51:19,682 --> 02:51:20,010
Speaker 0: Be safe.

1468
02:51:20,010 --> 02:51:41,329
Speaker 0: >> It's my car, Sergeant.

1469
02:51:41,329 --> 02:51:42,349
Speaker 0: >> Oh, yeah?

1470
02:51:42,349 --> 02:51:42,910
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

1471
02:51:43,210 --> 02:51:46,045
Speaker 0: I'm supposed to... When you got activated, I was like, "I'm not

1472
02:51:46,186 --> 02:51:46,448
Speaker 0: coming.".

1473
02:51:46,448 --> 02:51:47,790
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, I'm already here.

1474
02:51:47,790 --> 02:51:55,370
Speaker 0: >> Not that I'm aware of, but we still had it open.

1475
02:51:55,370 --> 02:51:58,770
Speaker 0: >> It'd be funny if the guy just kept on going.

1476
02:51:58,770 --> 02:51:59,846
Speaker 0: >> Fuck you!

1477
02:51:59,846 --> 02:52:02,410
Speaker 0: >> Common, Clarendon, Common, Fairfield, Common, Gloucester.

1478
02:52:03,250 --> 02:52:03,950
Speaker 0: Hoopery and Exeter.

1479
02:52:03,950 --> 02:52:10,940
Speaker 0: >> What the hell are you talking about?

1480
02:52:10,940 --> 02:52:13,131
Speaker 0: >> I thought this was a state house over there.

1481
02:52:13,131 --> 02:52:19,277
Speaker 0: >> If anybody actually thought they were going to a fucking state house, I mean, come on.

1482
02:52:19,277 --> 02:52:21,840
Speaker 0: >> Like, how did we, you know what I mean?

1483
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:33,980
Speaker 0: >> Like, it's played out in different cities before it happened here, like... >> To me, it just seemed like when you got here, it was when you stopped, you know what I mean?

1484
02:52:34,061 --> 02:52:35,080
Speaker 0: The movement just stopped.

1485
02:52:35,080 --> 02:52:35,660
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

1486
02:52:35,660 --> 02:52:36,300
Speaker 0: >> You parked it here.

1487
02:52:36,300 --> 02:52:50,499
Speaker 0: >> What's up?

1488
02:52:50,499 --> 02:52:53,467
Speaker 0: >> Oh, yeah.

1489
02:52:53,467 --> 02:52:55,999
Speaker 0: >> What's up?

1490
02:52:55,999 --> 02:52:56,780
Speaker 0: >> This is mine.

1491
02:52:56,780 --> 02:52:59,260
Speaker 0: >> Thank you for your service.

1492
02:52:59,260 --> 02:52:59,820
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

1493
02:53:00,885 --> 02:53:01,700
Speaker 0: When did you guys get here?

1494
02:53:01,700 --> 02:53:03,080
Speaker 0: >> 20 minutes ago.

1495
02:53:03,080 --> 02:53:05,160
Speaker 0: >> This is fucking wild, dude.

1496
02:53:05,160 --> 02:53:05,980
Speaker 0: >> You've been going all day?

1497
02:53:05,980 --> 02:53:06,760
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

1498
02:53:06,760 --> 02:53:08,560
Speaker 0: >> No time to stop.

1499
02:53:08,560 --> 02:53:12,919
Speaker 0: >> Did you get ordered in?

1500
02:53:12,919 --> 02:53:16,240
Speaker 0: >> No, this is my regular... Well, now I'm going overtime.

1501
02:53:16,240 --> 02:53:18,279
Speaker 0: >> Oh, it's even worse.

1502
02:53:18,279 --> 02:53:23,190
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, all the guys are going now.

1503
02:53:23,190 --> 02:53:28,290
Speaker 0: >> We were like... We were inside Saks Fifth Avenue.

1504
02:53:28,511 --> 02:53:30,350
Speaker 0: They're fucking in there looting.

1505
02:53:31,052 --> 02:53:32,129
Speaker 0: We've locked up two.

1506
02:53:32,631 --> 02:53:35,630
Speaker 0: More of them fucking break in while we're fucking standing right there.

1507
02:53:35,791 --> 02:53:36,529
Speaker 0: Take another two.

1508
02:53:37,355 --> 02:53:37,970
Speaker 0: Go upstairs.

1509
02:53:38,312 --> 02:53:38,799
Speaker 0: There's three of them.

1510
02:53:40,895 --> 02:53:42,009
Speaker 0: Like, hands full of shit.

1511
02:53:42,654 --> 02:53:44,030
Speaker 0: I fucking gun-faced them.

1512
02:53:44,250 --> 02:53:45,090
Speaker 0: Two of them got away.

1513
02:53:45,170 --> 02:53:45,789
Speaker 0: We got one.

1514
02:53:45,789 --> 02:53:47,110
Speaker 0: >> Holy shit.

1515
02:53:47,110 --> 02:53:50,310
Speaker 0: >> They were doing it right in front of us.

1516
02:53:50,410 --> 02:53:51,449
Speaker 0: You should see their cruises.

1517
02:53:51,449 --> 02:53:52,970
Speaker 0: >> It's going to happen tomorrow, too.

1518
02:53:53,030 --> 02:53:54,230
Speaker 0: Didn't they burn two of your cars?

1519
02:53:54,230 --> 02:53:56,009
Speaker 0: >> I don't know if they burned them.

1520
02:53:56,556 --> 02:53:57,130
Speaker 0: Not here.

1521
02:53:57,351 --> 02:53:58,226
Speaker 0: They're fucking ruined.

1522
02:53:58,813 --> 02:53:59,429
Speaker 0: They're in an alley.

1523
02:53:59,733 --> 02:54:00,429
Speaker 0: One of these alleys.

1524
02:54:00,429 --> 02:54:03,329
Speaker 0: >> Holy shit.

1525
02:54:03,329 --> 02:54:05,429
Speaker 0: >> You know a place where we can take a piss?

1526
02:54:05,752 --> 02:54:05,928
Speaker 0: For real.

1527
02:54:05,928 --> 02:54:07,730
Speaker 0: >> I'm not going in the alley.

1528
02:54:07,730 --> 02:54:12,990
Speaker 0: >> You know how many fucking people were in that alley running away every time I fucking poked my head down there?

1529
02:54:12,990 --> 02:54:13,690
Speaker 0: >> Nothing's open.

1530
02:54:13,690 --> 02:54:15,929
Speaker 0: >> I don't feel like getting assaulted by those fucking... Look at those pork chops.

1531
02:54:16,630 --> 02:54:17,348
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

1532
02:54:17,348 --> 02:54:19,550
Speaker 0: >> I haven't gotten a haircut in three months.

1533
02:54:19,550 --> 02:54:21,707
Speaker 0: >> Dude, you're a fucking '70s porn star.

1534
02:54:21,707 --> 02:54:23,046
Speaker 0: >> Oh, yeah.

1535
02:54:24,398 --> 02:54:24,767
Speaker 0: I like it.

1536
02:54:24,767 --> 02:54:26,870
Speaker 0: >> That is amazing.

1537
02:54:26,870 --> 02:54:28,750
Speaker 0: >> What?

1538
02:54:28,750 --> 02:54:29,790
Speaker 0: >> What?

1539
02:54:29,790 --> 02:54:30,970
Speaker 0: >> The camera.

1540
02:54:30,970 --> 02:54:32,589
Speaker 0: >> That's okay.

1541
02:54:33,053 --> 02:54:33,468
Speaker 0: That's amazing.

1542
02:54:34,375 --> 02:54:34,948
Speaker 0: I love it.

1543
02:54:35,450 --> 02:54:36,008
Speaker 0: You do it great.

1544
02:54:37,876 --> 02:54:38,349
Speaker 0: You do it great.

1545
02:54:38,349 --> 02:54:39,730
Speaker 0: >> Fucking one-way street.

1546
02:54:39,730 --> 02:54:40,470
Speaker 0: >> This is great.

1547
02:54:40,470 --> 02:54:41,549
Speaker 0: >> So it's going to be tomorrow, too?

1548
02:54:41,549 --> 02:54:42,949
Speaker 0: >> I'll be off.

1549
02:54:43,231 --> 02:54:44,010
Speaker 0: Fuck this place.

1550
02:54:44,010 --> 02:54:46,990
Speaker 0: >> You'll be here.

1551
02:54:46,990 --> 02:54:48,350
Speaker 0: >> No, no, no, no, no.

1552
02:54:48,350 --> 02:54:50,610
Speaker 0: >> No tomorrow.

1553
02:54:50,610 --> 02:54:57,970
Speaker 0: >> We were building security at the station because on Friday they came and it was not good.

1554
02:54:58,912 --> 02:55:09,870
Speaker 0: And then they were acting up down at Common and they had us get in a fucking van and drive to Newbury Street.

1555
02:55:10,750 --> 02:55:14,810
Speaker 0: And it was complete and utter chaos and lawlessness.

1556
02:55:16,013 --> 02:55:19,370
Speaker 0: They smashed a cruiser literally that far away from me.

1557
02:55:20,412 --> 02:55:24,650
Speaker 0: They broke into a building, lit it on fire while we were just standing there.

1558
02:55:26,010 --> 02:55:27,350
Speaker 0: Fucking insanity.

1559
02:55:29,894 --> 02:55:31,009
Speaker 0: There was only, like, eight of us.

1560
02:55:31,009 --> 02:55:34,517
Speaker 0: >> No, he's fooling around.

1561
02:55:40,630 --> 02:55:41,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think he's with a canner.

1562
02:55:41,449 --> 02:55:44,476
Speaker 0: >> No, he's cheating.

1563
02:55:44,476 --> 02:55:45,595
Speaker 0: >> Oh, nice.

1564
02:55:46,120 --> 02:55:46,267
Speaker 0: Awesome.

1565
02:55:46,267 --> 02:55:48,409
Speaker 0: >> All right.

1566
02:55:49,400 --> 02:55:49,919
Speaker 0: I figured I'd try.

1567
02:55:50,182 --> 02:55:51,240
Speaker 0: If you see him, we'll be around.

1568
02:55:51,240 --> 02:55:52,120
Speaker 0: >> Absolutely.

1569
02:55:52,820 --> 02:55:53,096
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

1570
02:55:53,096 --> 02:56:03,517
Speaker 0: >> You're not supposed to be with us, man.

1571
02:56:05,961 --> 02:56:08,099
Speaker 0: We're here to fight wars.

1572
02:56:08,099 --> 02:56:23,899
Speaker 0: >> 903, are you mobile, Sergeant?

1573
02:56:23,899 --> 02:56:31,480
Speaker 0: >> I want to shoot myself in the fucking head.

1574
02:56:31,480 --> 02:56:41,020
Speaker 0: >> I have a supervisor on the air with wheels at this time.

1575
02:56:41,020 --> 02:56:47,104
Speaker 0: >> Can you make it?

1576
02:56:47,104 --> 02:56:56,050
Speaker 0: >> I think he's still on the way.

1577
02:56:56,050 --> 02:57:04,748
Speaker 0: >> I'm pretending it was them mostly.

1578
02:57:05,574 --> 02:57:06,810
Speaker 0: They're actually pretty decent.

1579
02:57:06,810 --> 02:57:35,190
Speaker 0: >> He's like 12 years old.

1580
02:57:35,190 --> 02:57:36,688
Speaker 0: >> Really?

1581
02:57:36,688 --> 02:57:38,709
Speaker 0: >> Shut that down.

1582
02:57:39,134 --> 02:57:39,410
Speaker 0: He's a bomb.

1583
02:57:40,010 --> 02:57:40,605
Speaker 0: Somebody hit him.

1584
02:57:40,605 --> 02:57:44,370
Speaker 0: >> All right, you have that.

1585
02:57:44,430 --> 02:57:45,088
Speaker 0: We'll be doing a loop.

1586
02:57:45,088 --> 02:57:53,183
Speaker 0: >> Good work.

1587
02:57:59,870 --> 02:58:00,230
Speaker 0: You're safe.

1588
02:58:00,230 --> 02:58:04,050
Speaker 0: >> You could actually probably take a leak and just go in one of the buildings that got looted.

1589
02:58:04,393 --> 02:58:04,949
Speaker 0: I'm serious.

1590
02:58:05,451 --> 02:58:07,070
Speaker 0: Find an employee bathroom or something.

1591
02:58:07,070 --> 02:58:10,187
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, but I don't want to go walking through there with cameras and all that.

1592
02:58:10,187 --> 02:58:12,449
Speaker 0: >> I don't think anything's actually open.

1593
02:58:12,449 --> 02:58:15,390
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, but I don't want to be walking through in that.

1594
02:58:15,390 --> 02:58:16,809
Speaker 0: >> I got to go.

1595
02:58:17,390 --> 02:58:17,690
Speaker 0: Be safe.

1596
02:58:17,690 --> 02:58:23,751
Speaker 0: >> Watch yourself, son.

1597
02:58:46,294 --> 02:58:46,729
Speaker 0: Keep moving.

1598
02:58:46,729 --> 02:59:15,285
Speaker 0: >> Where are we going?

1599
02:59:15,285 --> 02:59:28,150
Speaker 0: >> We're going to take a stroll through the coffee mall.

1600
02:59:28,150 --> 03:00:02,060
Speaker 0: >> I'm broke from Columbus.

1601
03:00:02,300 --> 03:00:02,820
Speaker 0: That was the lift.

1602
03:00:02,820 --> 03:00:11,350
Speaker 0: >> I can't wait.

1603
03:00:11,651 --> 03:00:13,685
Speaker 0: I'm filling out a form 25 on my cruiser when I get there.

1604
03:00:13,685 --> 03:00:23,210
Speaker 0: >> Like you just parked where it's damaged.

1605
03:00:23,210 --> 03:00:31,340
Speaker 0: >> We've got a group of people going right into sites again.

1606
03:00:31,340 --> 03:00:32,178
Speaker 0: >> Oh, boy.

1607
03:00:32,178 --> 03:00:32,956
Speaker 0: >> Here we go.

1608
03:00:32,956 --> 03:00:34,960
Speaker 0: >> This is our specialty.

1609
03:00:34,960 --> 03:00:51,090
Speaker 0: >> Oh, my ass.

1610
03:00:51,090 --> 03:01:11,286
Speaker 0: >> Get down!

1611
03:01:11,286 --> 03:01:51,341
Speaker 0: >> Coming back.

1612
03:01:51,341 --> 03:02:15,770
Speaker 0: >> We're going upstairs.

1613
03:02:15,770 --> 03:02:18,920
Speaker 0: >> You guys good?

1614
03:02:18,920 --> 03:02:34,200
Speaker 0: >> Get the fuck down!

1615
03:02:34,200 --> 03:02:39,189
Speaker 0: >> We're trying to get back.

1616
03:02:39,189 --> 03:02:41,210
Speaker 0: >> Take the bag off.

1617
03:02:41,210 --> 03:02:47,517
Speaker 0: >> We need a couple more units on Ring Road.

1618
03:02:47,517 --> 03:03:02,480
Speaker 0: >> Stay here.

1619
03:03:02,621 --> 03:03:03,096
Speaker 0: Don't move.

1620
03:03:03,096 --> 03:03:36,847
Speaker 0: >> What?

1621
03:03:36,847 --> 03:03:42,450
Speaker 0: >> Go ahead.

1622
03:03:42,450 --> 03:03:44,530
Speaker 0: >> Sit up if you want.

1623
03:03:44,530 --> 03:03:49,475
Speaker 0: >> Ryan, I got one here.

1624
03:03:49,475 --> 03:04:02,089
Speaker 0: >> All right.

1625
03:04:02,089 --> 03:04:08,050
Speaker 0: >> We going to the trussing room?

1626
03:04:08,050 --> 03:04:08,559
Speaker 0: >> Yep.

1627
03:04:08,559 --> 03:04:09,887
Speaker 0: >> Stand up.

1628
03:04:10,250 --> 03:04:10,450
Speaker 0: You ready?

1629
03:04:10,450 --> 03:04:10,996
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

1630
03:04:10,996 --> 03:04:12,390
Speaker 0: >> Just roll onto your knee, okay?

1631
03:04:12,390 --> 03:04:13,690
Speaker 0: >> No, no, I got it.

1632
03:04:13,690 --> 03:04:13,948
Speaker 0: >> Okay.

1633
03:04:13,948 --> 03:04:15,130
Speaker 0: >> Thank you.

1634
03:04:15,130 --> 03:04:16,230
Speaker 0: >> Can you pat him down?

1635
03:04:16,230 --> 03:04:17,669
Speaker 0: >> I'll do it when we get back down.

1636
03:04:17,669 --> 03:04:26,860
Speaker 0: >> We need Ring Road for three more transports.

1637
03:04:27,441 --> 03:04:28,760
Speaker 0: Again, remember, the males are going up there.

1638
03:04:28,922 --> 03:04:29,679
Speaker 0: You need a female for six.

1639
03:04:29,679 --> 03:04:37,780
Speaker 0: >> We've got to wait for the wagon, so they can... >> Yeah.

1640
03:04:37,780 --> 03:04:47,640
Speaker 0: >> Got anything on you?

1641
03:04:48,060 --> 03:04:49,139
Speaker 0: Knives, guns, needles?

1642
03:04:49,461 --> 03:04:51,180
Speaker 0: If I get stuck, you're going to the hospital, too.

1643
03:04:51,180 --> 03:04:51,737
Speaker 0: >> Okay.

1644
03:04:51,737 --> 03:04:59,276
Speaker 0: >> What's this?

1645
03:04:59,276 --> 03:05:00,157
Speaker 0: >> I don't know.

1646
03:05:00,157 --> 03:05:01,581
Speaker 0: >> Come in there.

1647
03:05:01,581 --> 03:05:09,049
Speaker 0: >> Come and sit.

1648
03:05:09,049 --> 03:05:11,270
Speaker 0: >> Last I heard was Herford and Newberry.

1649
03:05:11,390 --> 03:05:11,990
Speaker 0: Let me check with Stacy.

1650
03:05:11,990 --> 03:05:14,390
Speaker 0: >> Sit down, please.

1651
03:05:14,390 --> 03:05:17,594
Speaker 0: >> ...towards Mass Dab on Newberry Street.

1652
03:05:21,440 --> 03:05:31,058
Speaker 0: There were three mobile troopers that were not assigned elsewhere that came down to join them, so they had a pretty good number of officers that were moving that group along.

1653
03:05:31,058 --> 03:05:31,614
Speaker 0: >> Huh?

1654
03:05:31,614 --> 03:05:33,386
Speaker 0: >> Just got a report.

1655
03:05:33,406 --> 03:05:37,260
Speaker 0: that group moved in Newberry and Mass Dab and now are breaking into Urban Outfitters.

1656
03:05:38,241 --> 03:05:40,176
Speaker 0: Newberry and Mass Dab breaking into Urban Outfitters.

1657
03:05:40,176 --> 03:05:52,840
Speaker 0: >> Probably four.

1658
03:05:52,840 --> 03:06:02,838
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, those spike locks that I had, they were actually holding a bomber down here, so... Is there anyone else that could move up to that group?

1659
03:06:02,838 --> 03:06:17,209
Speaker 0: >> Try it.

1660
03:06:17,209 --> 03:06:21,138
Speaker 0: >> Hello?

1661
03:06:21,138 --> 03:06:25,719
Speaker 0: >> The other one had three locked doors.

1662
03:06:25,719 --> 03:06:28,719
Speaker 0: >> The group is now moving towards Calm and Mass Dab.

1663
03:06:29,041 --> 03:06:30,220
Speaker 0: Calm and Mass Dab, they're moving on.

1664
03:06:30,220 --> 03:06:34,740
Speaker 0: >> There's probably more of them upstairs.

1665
03:06:34,740 --> 03:06:35,411
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

1666
03:06:35,411 --> 03:06:39,359
Speaker 0: >> I'll pick you up and I'll see you on QT4.

1667
03:06:39,359 --> 03:06:47,299
Speaker 0: >> Gentlemen, the store's closed.

1668
03:06:47,299 --> 03:06:52,467
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, bring the dog in.

1669
03:06:52,467 --> 03:07:10,448
Speaker 0: >> This fucking helmet, too.

1670
03:07:10,448 --> 03:07:17,849
Speaker 0: >> Hold on a second.

1671
03:07:17,849 --> 03:07:34,949
Speaker 0: >> They might have gone out the back.

1672
03:07:34,949 --> 03:07:39,930
Speaker 0: >> Oh, yeah, Snowberry, what do you need?

1673
03:07:39,930 --> 03:07:49,379
Speaker 0: >> Head towards Newberry and Mass Dab for a look at that group.

1674
03:07:49,379 --> 03:08:01,400
Speaker 0: >> Uh... >> They ran out last time that way.

1675
03:08:01,400 --> 03:08:02,696
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, Charlie

1676
03:08:02,696 --> 03:08:04,963
Speaker 0: 4. >>

1677
03:08:04,963 --> 03:08:06,915
Speaker 0: All right, so we're going to try on this post for you.

1678
03:08:08,045 --> 03:08:08,559
Speaker 0: What else, Tom?

1679
03:08:08,559 --> 03:08:11,418
Speaker 0: >> Uh, Dartmouth and St.

1680
03:08:11,438 --> 03:08:11,560
Speaker 0: James.

1681
03:08:17,180 --> 03:08:19,979
Speaker 0: You'll probably need at least two cruisers at Dartmouth and St.

1682
03:08:19,999 --> 03:08:20,180
Speaker 0: James.

1683
03:08:23,341 --> 03:08:26,218
Speaker 0: I know you have reports of people trying to break into the CBS at 285 Columbus.

1684
03:08:38,242 --> 03:08:40,680
Speaker 0: At 285 Columbus, CBS is getting looted right now.

1685
03:08:40,680 --> 03:09:10,202
Speaker 0: >> This is where they went out the exit.

1686
03:09:10,202 --> 03:09:23,877
Speaker 0: >> Nope.

1687
03:09:23,877 --> 03:09:35,747
Speaker 0: >> QT4.

1688
03:09:35,747 --> 03:09:36,788
Speaker 0: >> QT4.

1689
03:09:36,788 --> 03:10:00,570
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, just saw movement, right?

1690
03:10:00,570 --> 03:10:05,039
Speaker 0: >> Back there.

1691
03:10:05,039 --> 03:10:27,829
Speaker 0: >> They must have gone down.

1692
03:10:27,829 --> 03:10:31,990
Speaker 0: >> Get on the fucking ground!

1693
03:10:31,990 --> 03:10:32,390
Speaker 0: >> On the ground, now!

1694
03:10:32,390 --> 03:10:33,569
Speaker 0: >> Get on the ground, you're going to get shot!

1695
03:10:33,569 --> 03:10:34,888
Speaker 0: >> Get the fuck down!

1696
03:10:35,293 --> 03:10:35,504
Speaker 0: Down!

1697
03:10:36,333 --> 03:10:36,481
Speaker 0: Down!

1698
03:10:39,260 --> 03:10:40,238
Speaker 0: Put your hands behind your back.

1699
03:10:44,104 --> 03:10:44,940
Speaker 0: Stay on your stomach.

1700
03:10:44,940 --> 03:10:46,420
Speaker 0: >> I don't have cuffs.

1701
03:10:46,420 --> 03:10:50,579
Speaker 0: >> Watch the stairs, Matt.

1702
03:10:54,321 --> 03:10:55,740
Speaker 0: Okay, sir, do you have any weapons on you?

1703
03:10:55,740 --> 03:10:55,888
Speaker 0: >> No, sir.

1704
03:10:55,888 --> 03:10:58,759
Speaker 0: >> Roll on your side, I'm just going to check you, okay?

1705
03:10:58,759 --> 03:10:59,017
Speaker 0: >> Okay.

1706
03:10:59,017 --> 03:11:02,117
Speaker 0: >> Jewel.

1707
03:11:02,117 --> 03:11:05,198
Speaker 0: >> What flavor is it?

1708
03:11:06,265 --> 03:11:06,699
Speaker 0: Give it to me.

1709
03:11:06,699 --> 03:11:10,119
Speaker 0: >> All right, sir, roll up onto your knee.

1710
03:11:11,163 --> 03:11:11,718
Speaker 0: No, come on.

1711
03:11:12,161 --> 03:11:12,760
Speaker 0: Put your knee in front.

1712
03:11:12,901 --> 03:11:13,378
Speaker 0: Yeah, there you go.

1713
03:11:14,285 --> 03:11:14,493
Speaker 0: Step up.

1714
03:11:14,493 --> 03:11:15,995
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

1715
03:11:15,995 --> 03:11:18,680
Speaker 0: >> It's going to be nice for you if the annoying shit-fucking-idiot does, all right?

1716
03:11:18,680 --> 03:11:19,057
Speaker 0: >> Okay.

1717
03:11:19,057 --> 03:11:23,279
Speaker 0: >> Going downstairs, you are obviously under arrest.

1718
03:11:23,279 --> 03:11:28,349
Speaker 0: >> I think I dropped my phone.

1719
03:11:28,349 --> 03:11:30,210
Speaker 0: >> You want to help me get it out, please?

1720
03:11:30,210 --> 03:11:31,070
Speaker 0: >> No, go ahead.

1721
03:11:31,070 --> 03:11:33,349
Speaker 0: >> I'm not looking around the store for that.

1722
03:11:34,010 --> 03:11:35,708
Speaker 0: I've got other people in here fucking stealing shit.

1723
03:11:36,030 --> 03:11:37,330
Speaker 0: I don't want somebody to run behind us.

1724
03:11:37,330 --> 03:11:53,640
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, well, that's unfortunate.

1725
03:11:53,901 --> 03:11:55,060
Speaker 0: You can tell that to the judge later.

1726
03:11:55,060 --> 03:11:58,680
Speaker 0: >> Coming in with one!

1727
03:12:05,245 --> 03:12:06,120
Speaker 0: Got another one upstairs.

1730
03:12:09,419 --> 03:12:10,640
Speaker 0: >> I don't know, but I'm out of cuffs.

1731
03:12:10,760 --> 03:12:11,200
Speaker 0: How about you guys?

1732
03:12:11,200 --> 03:12:11,800

03:12:14,238 --> 03:12:15,559
Speaker 0: >> Okay, can Josh come back here?

03:12:23,020 --> 03:12:24,460
Speaker 0: >> At least one.

1741
03:12:24,460 --> 03:12:26,520
Speaker 0: >> You guys have cuffs?

03:12:26,520 --> 03:12:28,039
Speaker 0: >> They got a flex cuff.

1743
03:12:28,039 --> 03:12:29,240
Speaker 0: >> Okay.

1744
03:12:31,184 --> 03:12:32,119
Speaker 0: Let's bring this guy back, too.

1745
03:12:32,119 --> 03:12:34,278
Speaker 0: >> Can you get up?

1746
03:12:35,667 --> 03:12:35,899
Speaker 0: Get up.

1747
03:12:35,899 --> 03:12:36,558
Speaker 0: >> I'm going to try.

1748
03:12:36,680 --> 03:12:37,419
Speaker 0: You can help me up, please.

1749
03:12:37,419 --> 03:12:39,917
Speaker 0: >> One, two, three.

1750
03:12:39,917 --> 03:12:41,825
Speaker 0: >> What do you want?

1751
03:12:41,825 --> 03:12:45,170
Speaker 0: >> I don't want to lose it.

1752
03:12:45,170 --> 03:12:46,370
Speaker 0: >> Give it to me.

1753
03:12:46,431 --> 03:12:47,169
Speaker 0: I'll put it in your pocket.

1754
03:12:47,169 --> 03:12:47,830
Speaker 0: >> Thank you, brother.

1755
03:12:47,950 --> 03:12:48,429
Speaker 0: I appreciate it.

1756
03:12:52,554 --> 03:12:53,229
Speaker 0: This shit's stressful.

1759
03:12:55,872 --> 03:12:56,728
Speaker 0: What time you started today?

03:12:56,728 --> 03:12:57,969
Speaker 0: >> Four o'clock.

1761
03:12:59,492 --> 03:13:01,029
Speaker 0: We dealt with this shit Friday night, too.

1762
03:13:01,320 --> 03:13:01,490
Speaker 0: It's old.

1763
03:13:01,490 --> 03:13:04,408
Speaker 0: >> We'll be done with you, okay?

1764
03:13:05,030 --> 03:13:06,410
Speaker 0: But as of right now, you're under arrest.

Speaker 0: >> Delta Alpha 2D, need transport as well.

1820
03:15:51,420 --> 03:15:58,770
Speaker 0: >> Guys, somebody's got to keep that plaza street shut down.

1821
03:15:59,033 --> 03:15:59,910
Speaker 0: All the cars are coming up now.

1822
03:15:59,910 --> 03:16:02,269
Speaker 0: >> I can't take those plastic ones off.

1823
03:16:02,691 --> 03:16:05,030
Speaker 0: You have to cut them off, and you have to use special scissors.

1824
03:16:05,030 --> 03:16:13,160
Speaker 0: >> Delta Alpha 81, where are the prisoners going?

1825
03:16:25,840 --> 03:16:28,959
Speaker 0: Sergeant Rodriguez, see if you can send two more guys back to that cluster post.

1826
03:16:29,942 --> 03:16:31,260
Speaker 0: All those cars are coming right back up.

1827
03:16:34,782 --> 03:16:35,386
Speaker 0: I'll send them up there.

1828
03:16:35,407 --> 03:16:36,857
Speaker 0: We're just securing two right now, 888 Wilson.

1829
03:16:36,857 --> 03:16:41,579
Speaker 0: >> There's at least one other.

1830
03:16:41,841 --> 03:16:43,020
Speaker 0: How many were you up there with?

1831
03:16:45,984 --> 03:16:47,360
Speaker 0: How many people were you up there with?

1832
03:16:47,360 --> 03:16:48,977
Speaker 0: >> I came by myself, brother.

1833
03:16:48,977 --> 03:16:51,260
Speaker 0: >> No, it was you then, right?

1834
03:16:53,423 --> 03:16:54,599
Speaker 0: That I cuffed up there?

1835
03:16:57,703 --> 03:16:58,879
Speaker 0: Were you up there with somebody else?

1836
03:17:03,104 --> 03:17:03,679
Speaker 0: Just one guy.

1837
03:17:05,963 --> 03:17:07,839
Speaker 0: I just want to know how many people are still up there.

1838
03:17:07,839 --> 03:17:26,840
Speaker 0: >> Charlie 1, was there an announcement made on Channel 1 about officers doing a day tour tomorrow?

1839
03:17:27,140 --> 03:17:28,120
Speaker 0: That we're going to get on Channel

1840
03:17:28,120 --> 03:17:28,821
Speaker 0: 5? >>

1841
03:17:28,821 --> 03:17:30,320
Speaker 0: You want me to just shove this shit in their pockets?

1842
03:17:30,320 --> 03:17:31,448
Speaker 0: >> Yes, Timber.

1843
03:17:31,528 --> 03:17:31,953
Speaker 0: Let me clarify.

1844
03:17:32,074 --> 03:17:32,620
Speaker 0: I'll get back to you.

1845
03:17:32,620 --> 03:17:34,200
Speaker 0: >> I'll take it.

1846
03:17:34,200 --> 03:17:34,476
Speaker 0: >> Thank you.

1847
03:17:34,476 --> 03:17:42,770
Speaker 0: >> I'll give it to the guy right... >> I put a... Just like a fucking red line so you can read it.

1848
03:17:42,770 --> 03:17:43,402
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, that's fine.

1849
03:17:43,402 --> 03:17:45,550
Speaker 0: >> You can read my shit again right now.

1850
03:17:45,550 --> 03:17:46,227
Speaker 0: >> Delta Charlie

1851
03:17:46,227 --> 03:17:47,111
Speaker 0: 1. >>

1852
03:17:47,111 --> 03:17:48,141
Speaker 0: Deshawn Ward.

1853
03:17:48,161 --> 03:17:49,130
Speaker 0: That sounds familiar.

1854
03:17:49,130 --> 03:17:52,510
Speaker 0: >> Officers that are supposed to be in for the day tour were told to talk to all the supervisors.

1855
03:17:53,010 --> 03:17:53,810
Speaker 0: That's all we have so far.

1856
03:17:53,810 --> 03:17:57,428
Speaker 0: >> I'm going to change my uniform.

1857
03:17:57,428 --> 03:18:03,310
Speaker 0: >> Yes, up to the supervisor.

1858
03:18:03,310 --> 03:18:03,695
Speaker 0: >> Got it.

1859
03:18:03,715 --> 03:18:04,125
Speaker 0: Thank you.

1860
03:18:04,125 --> 03:18:10,599
Speaker 0: >> This is Channel 5 for me.

1861
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:18,460
Speaker 0: And I have the officers check with their supervisors and let me know... >> When you get booked, yeah.

1862
03:18:18,460 --> 03:18:20,918
Speaker 0: >> ...the locations they're at and we'll have some of these outside units assisted.

1863
03:18:20,918 --> 03:18:28,320
Speaker 0: >> Okay, all officers that are coming in for the day tour tomorrow, check with your supervisors about your staffing.

1864
03:18:29,581 --> 03:18:32,300
Speaker 0: And then supervisors, let Delta Charlie 1 know.

1865
03:18:32,300 --> 03:18:35,499
Speaker 0: >> It's already fucking 9 o'clock, man.

1866
03:18:35,499 --> 03:18:36,439
Speaker 0: >> Jesus.

1867
03:18:36,439 --> 03:18:40,179
Speaker 0: >> So we're waiting for transport now?

1868
03:18:40,179 --> 03:18:40,788
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

1869
03:18:40,788 --> 03:18:42,504
Speaker 0: >> We don't have any bus.

1870
03:18:42,504 --> 03:18:53,240
Speaker 0: >> That's the second time I've run out tonight.

1871
03:18:55,363 --> 03:18:57,140
Speaker 0: A lot of motherfuckers be acting the fool.

1872
03:18:58,200 --> 03:19:00,779
Speaker 0: It's a shame to use a tragedy like that for this.

1873
03:19:02,280 --> 03:19:04,260
Speaker 0: An excuse to go looting.

1874
03:19:04,961 --> 03:19:06,072
Speaker 0: Some man lost his life.

1875
03:19:08,400 --> 03:19:09,199
Speaker 0: Shameful shit.

1876
03:19:11,302 --> 03:19:13,700
Speaker 0: Obviously, you guys don't even care about the guy, right?

1877
03:19:36,936 --> 03:19:41,060
Speaker 0: I don't know where it is in this place, man.

1878
03:20:07,614 --> 03:20:09,070
Speaker 0: They're going to arraign you by phone.

1879
03:20:10,512 --> 03:20:11,898
Speaker 0: And then you'll make bail.

1880
03:20:11,958 --> 03:20:15,050
Speaker 0: It'll probably be like $40 because this county's a joke.

1881
03:20:15,050 --> 03:20:16,250
Speaker 0: >> What'd you say, bro?

1882
03:20:16,250 --> 03:20:16,950
Speaker 0: >> What?

1883
03:20:16,950 --> 03:20:18,326
Speaker 0: >> You said the bill would be like

1884
03:20:18,326 --> 03:20:19,393
Speaker 0: $40? >>

1885
03:20:19,393 --> 03:20:25,565
Speaker 0: I don't set it, but that's... >> All right, well, we're going to get you transported, so we'll get you out of here.

1886
03:20:25,565 --> 03:20:29,138
Speaker 0: >> Delta 9-3.

1887
03:20:29,138 --> 03:20:31,043
Speaker 0: >> Delta 9-3.

1888
03:20:31,043 --> 03:20:35,965
Speaker 0: >> We've got a form monitor at Saks Fifth Avenue.

1889
03:20:36,025 --> 03:20:36,869
Speaker 0: Ring right back.

1890
03:20:36,869 --> 03:20:38,884
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, these four.

1891
03:20:38,884 --> 03:20:40,390
Speaker 0: >> Four more in the custody.

1892
03:20:40,390 --> 03:20:44,283
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, so we're just looking for a transport.

1893
03:20:44,304 --> 03:20:45,270
Speaker 0: We're going to get them all out of here.

1894
03:20:45,270 --> 03:20:58,393
Speaker 0: >> Delta 4-2-5, what's that message?

1895
03:20:58,393 --> 03:21:01,678
Speaker 0: >> We need a transport.

1896
03:21:01,678 --> 03:21:02,838
Speaker 0: >> You from Boston?

1897
03:21:02,838 --> 03:21:05,800
Speaker 0: >> 2-5, can you transport this from Saks Fifth Avenue?

1898
03:21:05,800 --> 03:21:07,119
Speaker 0: >> We've got four more.

1899
03:21:07,119 --> 03:21:08,728
Speaker 0: >> At least that's the ending.

1900
03:21:08,728 --> 03:21:11,678
Speaker 0: >> Where are you from?

1901
03:21:11,678 --> 03:21:13,133
Speaker 0: >> Travis.

1902
03:21:13,133 --> 03:21:23,729
Speaker 0: >> You guys weren't here at Saks Fifth Avenue?

1903
03:21:23,729 --> 03:21:24,569
Speaker 0: >> That's fucked up.

1904
03:21:24,569 --> 03:21:26,726
Speaker 0: >> Where is he from?

1905
03:21:26,726 --> 03:21:28,118
Speaker 0: >> Who is this guy?

1906
03:21:28,118 --> 03:21:31,583
Speaker 0: >> You from around here?

1907
03:21:31,583 --> 03:21:45,016
Speaker 0: >> Right now, you guys are just going to get transported, and we'll probably be out of here quickly.

1908
03:21:45,016 --> 03:21:58,576
Speaker 0: >> Hello, this is Delta Charlie 1.

1909
03:21:58,576 --> 03:21:59,680
Speaker 0: Can you give me your location?

1910
03:21:59,680 --> 03:22:02,740
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, you'll get there, you'll get booked, and then you don't have to come back.

1911
03:22:02,740 --> 03:22:06,555
Speaker 0: >> We're not even sure yet.

1912
03:22:06,595 --> 03:22:09,770
Speaker 0: The transportation is going to be filled out, so you're going to have to go on the other side of the city.

1913
03:22:09,770 --> 03:22:11,509
Speaker 0: >> Hey, how are you?

1914
03:22:11,509 --> 03:22:13,207
Speaker 0: >> You think I'm fucking blind?

1915
03:22:13,207 --> 03:22:14,750
Speaker 0: >> You think we're going to be five people in the rest of the city?

1916
03:22:14,750 --> 03:22:19,355
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, we can't bail you, though.

1917
03:22:19,375 --> 03:22:20,940
Speaker 0: That's a bail magistrate.

1918
03:22:20,940 --> 03:22:25,549
Speaker 0: >> I can't.

1919
03:22:25,549 --> 03:22:26,374
Speaker 0: >> Well, you can.

1920
03:22:26,394 --> 03:22:27,862
Speaker 0: Come down.

1921
03:22:28,244 --> 03:22:29,430
Speaker 0: But first, you've got to get booked.

1922
03:22:29,430 --> 03:22:34,070
Speaker 0: >> Then the bail magistrate has to come, and then you've got to give him the money.

1923
03:22:34,070 --> 03:22:36,758
Speaker 0: >> It's a long process.

1924
03:22:36,819 --> 03:22:38,490
Speaker 0: It's a long process.

1925
03:22:38,490 --> 03:22:42,681
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, how about everybody else?

1926
03:22:42,701 --> 03:22:43,346
Speaker 0: You guys want to go, too?

1927
03:22:43,366 --> 03:22:43,810
Speaker 0: You want to go?

1928
03:22:43,810 --> 03:22:45,809
Speaker 0: >> I want to fucking go.

1929
03:22:45,809 --> 03:22:48,205
Speaker 0: >> We're going to do that.

1930
03:22:48,205 --> 03:22:54,370
Speaker 0: >> Look, if you get a job and buy this stuff, you're going to get in trouble.

1931
03:22:54,370 --> 03:22:56,141
Speaker 0: >> I wish I would get fired.

1932
03:22:56,161 --> 03:22:57,169
Speaker 0: This job sucks.

1933
03:22:57,169 --> 03:23:00,274
Speaker 0: >> If you get a job and buy this stuff, how would that work?

1934
03:23:00,274 --> 03:23:04,910
Speaker 0: >> Oh, yeah.

1935
03:23:05,072 --> 03:23:05,760
Speaker 0: Did you find him?

1936
03:23:05,760 --> 03:23:12,612
Speaker 0: >> He might have got out, too.

1937
03:23:12,652 --> 03:23:13,174
Speaker 0: I mean, who knows?

1938
03:23:13,194 --> 03:23:14,600
Speaker 0: He could have fucking snuck down and got out, too.

1939
03:23:14,600 --> 03:23:16,224
Speaker 0: >> 903, we do have four to go.

1940
03:23:16,224 --> 03:23:31,940
Speaker 0: >> The one idiot actually fucking got down when I told him I was going to shoot him.

1941
03:23:31,940 --> 03:23:34,819
Speaker 0: >> The other guy booked it.

1942
03:23:34,819 --> 03:23:38,800
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, this guy had to drive down, and he went into the fucking closet.

1943
03:23:38,800 --> 03:23:41,559
Speaker 0: >> Luckily, the key was sitting right at the door.

1944
03:23:41,559 --> 03:23:52,725
Speaker 0: >> That was good.

1945
03:23:52,785 --> 03:23:53,307
Speaker 0: I heard that.

1946
03:23:53,307 --> 03:23:58,721
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

1947
03:23:58,801 --> 03:24:01,383
Speaker 0: You should get a pair of corduroys.

1948
03:24:01,383 --> 03:24:27,899
Speaker 0: >> Looks good.

1949
03:24:27,899 --> 03:24:31,740
Speaker 0: >> I don't think they even have price tags on their clothes here.

1950
03:24:31,740 --> 03:24:32,980
Speaker 0: >> Fuck yeah.

1951
03:24:32,980 --> 03:24:52,443
Speaker 0: >> This is so outrageous.

1952
03:24:52,443 --> 03:25:08,362
Speaker 0: >> All right.

1953
03:25:08,402 --> 03:25:08,943
Speaker 0: That's good.

1954
03:25:08,983 --> 03:25:10,466
Speaker 0: You should roll with that.

1955
03:25:10,466 --> 03:25:18,639
Speaker 0: >> That's fucking amazing.

1956
03:25:18,639 --> 03:25:20,220
Speaker 0: >> I think we're all out of cuffs.

1957
03:25:20,220 --> 03:25:20,942
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

1958
03:25:21,002 --> 03:25:22,434
Speaker 0: We've got one more.

1959
03:25:22,434 --> 03:25:25,419
Speaker 0: >> Can we bring out a mannequin?

1960
03:25:25,419 --> 03:25:27,860
Speaker 0: >> That would be funny.

1961
03:25:27,860 --> 03:25:29,038
Speaker 0: >> I can get a girlfriend here.

1962
03:25:29,038 --> 03:25:36,180
Speaker 0: >> The troopers gave me the rustiest cuff in the state police.

1963
03:25:36,180 --> 03:25:38,394
Speaker 0: >> I have to put these on anybody.

1964
03:25:38,414 --> 03:25:39,040
Speaker 0: You know what I mean?

1965
03:25:39,040 --> 03:25:41,131
Speaker 0: >> Sorry, dude.

1966
03:25:41,151 --> 03:25:41,800
Speaker 0: That's why I live by you.

1967
03:25:41,800 --> 03:25:48,146
Speaker 0: >> Oh, shit.

1968
03:25:48,146 --> 03:25:53,581
Speaker 0: >> Who cares?

1969
03:25:53,581 --> 03:26:14,743
Speaker 0: >> He can take your cruiser, Brian.

1970
03:26:14,743 --> 03:26:17,490
Speaker 0: >> My car's total.

1971
03:26:17,490 --> 03:26:19,250
Speaker 0: >> You guys don't have cruisers?

1972
03:26:19,250 --> 03:26:22,950
Speaker 0: >> They fucking smash them right in front of us.

1973
03:26:22,950 --> 03:26:31,388
Speaker 0: >> So what we're going to do is once we get these guys transported, we'll go merge in with somebody else and we'll get you right back to the station.

1974
03:26:31,388 --> 03:26:33,529
Speaker 0: >> I'm going to fill out my slip tomorrow.

1975
03:26:33,529 --> 03:26:33,844
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

1976
03:26:33,844 --> 03:26:34,532
Speaker 0: >> It's a two-liner.

1977
03:26:34,532 --> 03:26:39,205
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

1978
03:26:39,205 --> 03:26:42,401
Speaker 0: >> And they have to go through three different doors.

1979
03:26:42,401 --> 03:26:55,363
Speaker 0: >> Are you just on the first half?

1980
03:26:55,363 --> 03:27:03,520
Speaker 0: >> Anybody?

1981
03:27:03,520 --> 03:27:07,756
Speaker 0: >> I want to go home, dude.

1982
03:27:07,756 --> 03:27:08,959
Speaker 0: >> So don't I.

1983
03:27:08,959 --> 03:27:09,859
Speaker 0: >> This sucks.

1984
03:27:09,859 --> 03:27:11,079
Speaker 0: >> But look at it this way.

1985
03:27:11,960 --> 03:27:17,270
Speaker 0: You can go do the two separate reports, fucking three lines each, and then fucking.

1986
03:27:17,291 --> 03:27:18,100
Speaker 0: just stay off the air.

1987
03:27:18,481 --> 03:27:19,939
Speaker 0: And I'll go merge up with somebody else.

1988
03:27:20,483 --> 03:27:21,700
Speaker 0: And then the two of you are out of here.

1989
03:27:22,500 --> 03:27:23,148
Speaker 0: I mean, there's reports.

1990
03:27:23,168 --> 03:27:25,760
Speaker 0: We'll take your fucking... >> Isn't it all one report?

1991
03:27:25,760 --> 03:27:30,259
Speaker 0: >> No, we'll do the two different reports for sacks, because it's two totally different times.

1992
03:27:30,259 --> 03:27:32,958
Speaker 0: >> Right, but five and five... >> Five.

1993
03:27:32,958 --> 03:27:35,080
Speaker 0: >> So it's four now, right?

1994
03:27:35,080 --> 03:27:37,520
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, so we've got four now, so it'll be two reports.

1995
03:27:37,681 --> 03:27:39,920
Speaker 0: Four in one report, and five in the first report.

1996
03:27:39,920 --> 03:27:42,240
Speaker 0: >> I still have to summons the other guy.

1997
03:27:44,262 --> 03:27:45,399
Speaker 0: The Ward and Taylor guy.

1998
03:27:45,399 --> 03:27:46,191
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, right.

1999
03:27:46,211 --> 03:27:46,599
Speaker 0: Do you really?

2000
03:27:46,599 --> 03:27:47,658
Speaker 0: >> No.

2001
03:27:47,658 --> 03:27:50,559
Speaker 0: >> I mean, the summons can wait a couple days.

2002
03:27:51,460 --> 03:27:52,600
Speaker 0: It's nothing urgent there.

2003
03:27:52,600 --> 03:28:00,130
Speaker 0: >> Where are they even going?

2004
03:28:00,130 --> 03:28:01,729
Speaker 0: >> I didn't get any shots in.

2005
03:28:01,729 --> 03:28:04,330
Speaker 0: >> Where are they going?

2006
03:28:04,330 --> 03:28:05,929
Speaker 0: >> We don't know yet.

2007
03:28:05,929 --> 03:28:08,850
Speaker 0: >> How can you even write the one-one?

2008
03:28:09,396 --> 03:28:10,690
Speaker 0: You can't start it until they're booked.

2009
03:28:10,690 --> 03:28:11,306
Speaker 0: >> Oh, yeah.

2010
03:28:12,290 --> 03:28:13,509
Speaker 0: At least we'll have to find out when they're booked.

2011
03:28:13,509 --> 03:28:18,930
Speaker 0: >> It's going to be hours, probably, because every place is filled.

2012
03:28:18,930 --> 03:28:19,459
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

2013
03:28:19,459 --> 03:28:30,979
Speaker 0: >> It would probably be beneficial to have him do it if he's coming in the morning, because then they'll all be done by then.

2014
03:28:30,979 --> 03:28:32,188
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

2015
03:28:32,330 --> 03:28:36,680
Speaker 0: We'll see where they're going, what the line's looking like, and where the other guys went.

2016
03:28:36,740 --> 03:28:37,480
Speaker 0: Do we know where they went?

2017
03:28:37,480 --> 03:28:38,402
Speaker 0: >> Who?

2018
03:28:39,207 --> 03:28:40,154
Speaker 0: Like Mike and stuff?

2019
03:28:40,315 --> 03:28:41,040
Speaker 0: Or the prisoners?

2020
03:28:41,040 --> 03:28:42,840
Speaker 0: >> Yeah, the first group.

2021
03:28:42,840 --> 03:28:44,339
Speaker 0: >> I think they went to four.

2022
03:28:44,339 --> 03:28:55,660
Speaker 0: >> Shut up, Abishai.

2023
03:28:59,824 --> 03:29:02,979
Speaker 0: There's probably fucking 15 phones littered around this place.

2024
03:29:02,979 --> 03:29:05,800
Speaker 0: >> Can I get my phone?

2025
03:29:05,800 --> 03:29:06,378
Speaker 0: >> No.

2026
03:29:06,378 --> 03:29:58,580
Speaker 0: >> I was freezing earlier, and now I'm running around this motherfucker all night.

2027
03:29:58,580 --> 03:29:59,040
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

2028
03:29:59,040 --> 03:30:02,014
Speaker 0: >> Someone called and was like, "Hey, this is what you're going to do

2029
03:30:02,055 --> 03:30:02,279
Speaker 0: tonight.".

2030
03:30:02,381 --> 03:30:02,586
Speaker 0: I'm like,

2031
03:30:02,627 --> 03:30:02,874
Speaker 0: "What?".

2032
03:30:02,874 --> 03:30:05,390
Speaker 0: >> This is going to be one that I--.

2033
03:30:05,390 --> 03:30:09,452
Speaker 0: >> That was fucking--.

2034
03:30:10,241 --> 03:30:12,060
Speaker 0: I've got to tell you guys, that was awesome over there.

2035
03:30:12,342 --> 03:30:13,500
Speaker 0: Everybody took a fucking flight.

2036
03:30:13,500 --> 03:30:15,558
Speaker 0: >> Where are you going?

2037
03:30:15,558 --> 03:30:18,294
Speaker 0: >> I was yelling at this guy, "This is nothing for

2038
03:30:18,355 --> 03:30:18,476
Speaker 0: me!".

2039
03:30:18,476 --> 03:30:19,952
Speaker 0: >> I can't believe that idiot.

2040
03:30:19,992 --> 03:30:21,878
Speaker 0: we got upstairs actually got on the ground.

2041
03:30:21,878 --> 03:30:22,165
Speaker 0: >> I know.

2042
03:30:22,186 --> 03:30:22,620
Speaker 0: I couldn't believe it.

2043
03:30:32,858 --> 03:30:33,268
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

2044
03:30:33,268 --> 03:30:37,589
Speaker 0: >> Everything's filled up, I guess.

2045
03:30:37,589 --> 03:30:39,167
Speaker 0: >> How many cells are in--.

2046
03:30:39,167 --> 03:30:42,550
Speaker 0: >> This is the booking officer.

2047
03:30:42,877 --> 03:30:43,027
Speaker 0: Izzy!

2048
03:30:46,232 --> 03:30:46,418
Speaker 0: Izzy!

2049
03:30:48,824 --> 03:30:50,438
Speaker 0: How many cells are at District

2050
03:30:50,438 --> 03:30:52,860
Speaker 0: 4? >> 20. >>

2051
03:30:52,860 --> 03:30:55,543
Speaker 0: Holy shit, we fucking have one.

2052
03:30:55,543 --> 03:31:06,030
Speaker 0: >> We've got one cell.

2053
03:31:06,030 --> 03:31:09,290
Speaker 0: >> I need new gloves now.

2054
03:31:09,630 --> 03:31:11,030
Speaker 0: This thing's a toy the fuck up.

2055
03:31:11,030 --> 03:31:14,863
Speaker 0: >> Three females, two juveniles, and five I-15s.

2056
03:31:14,863 --> 03:31:25,320
Speaker 0: >> I'd say it turned out to be a little more fun than I expected.

2057
03:31:25,320 --> 03:31:29,239
Speaker 0: >> We should just fucking stay in here and pick them off as they come in.

2058
03:31:29,239 --> 03:31:34,908
Speaker 0: >> Hope that's not fucking Metrolet coming in with dogs.

2059
03:31:39,786 --> 03:31:40,039
Speaker 0: Hey, now.

2060
03:31:40,280 --> 03:31:41,140
Speaker 0: Hey, could you do me a favor?

2061
03:31:42,301 --> 03:31:46,159
Speaker 0: We had five guys brought to D4 under arrest for being E up at SACS.

2062
03:31:47,465 --> 03:31:49,700
Speaker 0: Could you just check on their booking status for me real quick?

2063
03:31:49,700 --> 03:31:51,379
Speaker 0: >> They're getting booked right now.

2064
03:31:51,379 --> 03:31:52,019
Speaker 0: >> Oh, they are?

2065
03:31:52,342 --> 03:31:53,439
Speaker 0: How many guys are we in?

2066
03:31:53,784 --> 03:31:54,040
Speaker 0: Do we know?

2067
03:31:58,101 --> 03:32:00,643
Speaker 0: Okay, so you already have four booked?

2068
03:32:13,464 --> 03:32:14,200
Speaker 0: Okay, awesome.

2069
03:32:14,400 --> 03:32:22,900
Speaker 0: So I'm going to send Astrid in to start that report, and I'm going to be relieving Almeida momentarily once we get these next four transported.

2070
03:32:23,422 --> 03:32:23,920
Speaker 0: All right, thanks.

2071
03:32:26,883 --> 03:32:28,019
Speaker 0: They're all being E at SACS.

2072
03:32:28,220 --> 03:32:29,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is like fucking our fishing ground.

2073
03:32:29,780 --> 03:32:37,628
Speaker 0: >> Hey, I'm done, man.

2074
03:32:37,690 --> 03:32:39,489
Speaker 0: You have to have these rusty-ass fucking cups, man.

2075
03:32:39,489 --> 03:32:43,151
Speaker 0: >> So they're getting transported to 18.

2076
03:32:43,151 --> 03:32:44,750
Speaker 0: You guys are both going to get out of here.

2077
03:32:44,750 --> 03:32:46,190
Speaker 0: >> You're going to write this?

2078
03:32:46,190 --> 03:32:55,702
Speaker 0: >> No, the first five are going to be booked to four, so he's going to write that one, and then I'm thinking the other four might not be for a while, so they're not going to wait for the one-one on them anyway, right?

2079
03:32:55,702 --> 03:33:08,416
Speaker 0: >> Yeah.

2080
03:33:08,416 --> 03:33:15,027
Speaker 0: >> I find it hard to believe that you guys don't have WD-40 in the fucking thing.

2081
03:33:15,027 --> 03:33:19,309
Speaker 0: >> These things have just been sitting in the microwave for a while.

2082
03:33:23,840 --> 03:33:24,154
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

2083
03:33:24,154 --> 03:33:28,657
Speaker 0: >> What the fucking Walgreens here?

2084
03:33:28,657 --> 03:33:31,400
Speaker 0: >> They're hitting the Walgreens again.

2085
03:33:31,400 --> 03:33:31,817
Speaker 0: >> Prescription?

2086
03:33:31,817 --> 03:33:32,559
Speaker 0: >> Where?

2087
03:33:32,559 --> 03:33:34,960
Speaker 0: >> This is safe back there.

2088
03:33:34,960 --> 03:33:35,440
Speaker 0: >> I think so, yeah.

2089
03:33:35,921 --> 03:33:36,299
Speaker 0: the prescription.

2090
03:33:36,299 --> 03:33:39,584
Speaker 0: >> We got to go back to the van.

2091
03:33:44,072 --> 03:33:45,010
Speaker 0: Is your bag in there?

2092
03:33:45,010 --> 03:33:46,189
Speaker 0: >> My bag's in the van.

2093
03:33:46,189 --> 03:33:47,389
Speaker 0: >> If it's still there.

2094
03:33:47,389 --> 03:33:48,790
Speaker 0: >> They might have told it, yeah.

2095
03:33:53,793 --> 03:33:54,142
Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

2096
03:33:54,142 --> 03:34:07,288
Speaker 0: >> If they wanted it, they can have it.

Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

2098
03:34:12,608 --> 03:34:18,477
Speaker 0: >> Oh, in that bag of watches?

2099
03:34:18,477 --> 03:34:23,570
Speaker 0: >> Look at the bag.

2100
03:34:23,570 --> 03:34:24,198
Speaker 0: >> Jesus.

2101
03:34:24,198 --> 03:34:30,729
Speaker 0: >> He didn't come in here without a plan.

2102
03:34:32,511 --> 03:34:33,520
Speaker 0: I know this is an expedition.

2103
03:34:33,520 --> 03:34:35,065
Speaker 0: >> Yeah?

2104
03:34:35,065 --> 03:34:37,827
Speaker 0: >> Actually, we need security to come back here.

2105
03:34:37,827 --> 03:34:40,867
Speaker 0: >> Why didn't they fucking secure it?

2106

Speaker 0: [radio chatter].

2107
03:34:59,838 --> 03:35:21,539

03:36:07,280 --> 03:36:08,006
Speaker 0: >> Where'd they go?

2117
03:36:08,006 --> 03:36:10,860
Speaker 0: >> We heard 'em barking.

2118
03:36:10,860 --> 03:36:12,919
Speaker 0: >> You didn't see a group down here?

2119
03:36:12,919 --> 03:36:14,760
Speaker 0: >> We heard the dogs, but we didn't see any of them.

2120

2121
03:36:19,379 --> 03:36:22,840

Speaker 0: Fuck, it's no shit.

2124
03:37:28,991 --> 03:37:43,810
Speaker 0: It's pretty good, but even if we can get to your crew, it's... Okay, 'cause I'd like, you know, to assist Brookline and have someone get the info from Brookline for their B&E, and we'll handle that for them, just get all the info of what they observed.

2125
03:37:44,658 --> 03:37:45,290
Speaker 0: Alright, shit.

2126
03:37:48,310 --> 03:37:51,406
Speaker 0: Did you copy that, Brian?

2127
03:37:52,978 --> 03:37:53,489
Speaker 0: I am sorry.

2128
03:37:54,431 --> 03:37:58,170
Speaker 0: Tampa, we're not off of Brookline, this is a completely separate incident.

2129
03:37:58,490 --> 03:37:59,629
Speaker 0: Inside Saks, what's happening?

2130
03:38:04,731 --> 03:38:06,836
Speaker 0: Delta, Charlie 1.

2131
03:38:06,836 --> 03:38:07,776
Speaker 0: Charlie 1.

2132
03:38:07,776 --> 03:38:07,990
Speaker 0: Metro.

2133
03:38:08,858 --> 03:38:09,149
Speaker 0: Oh, Metro.

2134
03:38:09,571 --> 03:38:11,350
Speaker 0: Do we have someone that can assist Brookline up there?

2135
03:38:14,193 --> 03:38:14,770
Speaker 0: Trying to find someone.

2136
03:38:19,725 --> 03:38:20,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's Metro, Metro.

2137
03:38:21,442 --> 03:38:22,740
Speaker 0: That's the same guy that was just here.

2138
03:38:22,740 --> 03:38:23,599
Speaker 0: I didn't even see him come in.

2139
03:38:24,382 --> 03:38:26,460
Speaker 0: No, he like, came from another way, I think.

2140
03:38:26,681 --> 03:38:27,560
Speaker 0: Did he come from under there?

2141
03:38:27,742 --> 03:38:29,019
Speaker 0: No, there's one over there, too.

2142
03:38:41,082 --> 03:38:42,210
Speaker 0: Delta 9-3 to 4-2-5, it's on scene.

2143
03:38:42,251 --> 03:38:43,480
Speaker 0: We're getting a couple.

2144
03:38:48,089 --> 03:38:49,540
Speaker 0: Hey, let's grab two, guys.

2145
03:38:50,680 --> 03:38:51,520
Speaker 0: I don't know why I said that.

2146
03:38:54,140 --> 03:38:54,230
Speaker 0: Yeah.

2147
03:38:54,320 --> 03:38:54,413
Speaker 0: Yeah.

2148
03:39:09,706 --> 03:39:11,080
Speaker 0: You're not going to puke on me, are you?

2149
03:39:11,241 --> 03:39:11,637
Speaker 0: No, I'm fine.

2150
03:39:14,826 --> 03:39:15,480
Speaker 0: Got to go to the right.

2151
03:39:18,041 --> 03:39:19,499
Speaker 0: You're going to have to slide under this here.

2152
03:39:24,504 --> 03:39:25,300
Speaker 0: Watch your head, okay?

2153
03:39:26,125 --> 03:39:26,919
Speaker 0: And watch the glass.

2154
03:39:28,783 --> 03:39:29,473
Speaker 0: You're not going to run.

2155
03:39:35,807 --> 03:39:36,498
Speaker 0: Watch out for traffic.

2156
03:39:51,271 --> 03:39:52,179
Speaker 0: The same way you came in.

2157
03:39:58,610 --> 03:39:58,757
Speaker 0: Alright.

2158
03:40:24,221 --> 03:40:27,700
Speaker 0: Is there any chance we can get a bike dog to take this kid out?

2159
03:40:28,326 --> 03:40:28,920
Speaker 0: Be in the building.

2160
03:40:29,100 --> 03:40:31,239
Speaker 0: Is there any chance we can get a bus down to patch his leg up?

2161
03:40:32,241 --> 03:40:33,499
Speaker 0: Yeah, give me a second.

2162
03:40:34,440 --> 03:40:36,500
Speaker 0: There's supposed to be a transport on the way.

2163
03:40:36,940 --> 03:40:37,858
Speaker 0: Okay, for you guys, right?

2164
03:40:38,140 --> 03:40:38,819
Speaker 0: You just need an ambulance?

2165
03:40:39,584 --> 03:40:40,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, just so they can clean it up.

2166
03:40:49,553 --> 03:40:49,858
Speaker 0: Radio 9-7-0-6.

2167
03:40:59,063 --> 03:40:59,428
Speaker 0: Radio 9-7-0-6.

2168
03:41:03,401 --> 03:41:07,460
Speaker 0: Steve, could you start H&H to the Ring Road side of Saks?

2169
03:41:07,840 --> 03:41:10,560
Speaker 0: Nemlick, their canine, took a guy out.

2170
03:41:10,902 --> 03:41:12,020
Speaker 0: He's got an injury to the leg.

2171
03:41:16,483 --> 03:41:16,870
Speaker 0: Thank you.

2172
03:41:17,710 --> 03:41:18,019
Speaker 0: All set.

2173
03:41:18,240 --> 03:41:18,485
Speaker 0: Thank you.

2174
03:42:15,720 --> 03:42:19,441
Speaker 0: Is he going to puke again?

2175
03:42:50,933 --> 03:42:51,285
Speaker 0: I think so.

2176
03:43:19,978 --> 03:43:20,428
Speaker 0: Try it.

2177
03:43:22,595 --> 03:43:23,810
Speaker 0: Get out of here, clown.

2178
03:43:30,255 --> 03:43:31,029
Speaker 0: Stupid shipment.

2179
03:43:44,475 --> 03:43:45,609
Speaker 0: It's not like the old days.

2180
03:43:47,792 --> 03:43:51,190
Speaker 0: If this had been the '80s, there would have been a lot of cracked skulls.

2181
03:43:51,250 --> 03:43:52,129
Speaker 0: It would have been a wrap.

2182
03:43:54,112 --> 03:43:55,650
Speaker 0: You'd have to see him being in the hospital.

2183
03:44:11,793 --> 03:44:13,770
Speaker 0: You can't loosen them once they get tightened.

2184
03:44:29,901 --> 03:44:30,740
Speaker 0: Okay, I have the number.

2185
03:44:59,844 --> 03:45:01,380
Speaker 0: Is that the Western Hotel, is it?

2186
03:45:02,705 --> 03:45:03,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, that area.

2187
03:45:04,504 --> 03:45:04,998
Speaker 0: Okay, on the way.

2188
03:45:08,483 --> 03:45:08,847
Speaker 0: Radio 9-7-0-6.

2189
03:45:10,580 --> 03:45:11,129
Speaker 0: 9-7-0-6, sir.

2190
03:45:12,961 --> 03:45:17,020
Speaker 0: Sir, can I get a status of the transport that was requested by the 9-0-3 at Saks?

2191
03:45:18,124 --> 03:45:19,539
Speaker 0: I'm looking at that right now, stand by.

2192
03:45:35,620 --> 03:45:35,640
Speaker 0: 2-2.

2193
03:45:37,742 --> 03:45:38,960
Speaker 0: Where are we bringing state police arrests?

2194
03:45:39,883 --> 03:45:40,600
Speaker 0: Call of duty, right?

2195
03:45:47,431 --> 03:45:48,649
Speaker 0: Being told 18 at this time.

2196
03:46:29,629 --> 03:46:30,259
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

2197
03:46:30,804 --> 03:46:31,733
Speaker 0: We're getting cars now.

2198
03:46:39,530 --> 03:46:39,899
Speaker 0: Any more?

2199
03:46:50,501 --> 03:46:54,459
Speaker 0: Radio 9-7-0-6, you got Ambulance 24 and a tactical unit on the way to Austin.

2200
03:46:57,163 --> 03:46:58,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, T-3 just pulled up.

2201
03:46:59,102 --> 03:47:01,100
Speaker 0: Still need the transport for these four prisoners.

2202
03:47:04,500 --> 03:47:06,820
Speaker 0: Okay, and the wagon, the Harry wagon is coming.

2203
03:47:07,040 --> 03:47:08,620
Speaker 0: They're working off a list and they should be alive.

2204
03:47:10,180 --> 03:47:10,386
Speaker 0: Thank you.

2205
03:47:12,203 --> 03:47:13,239
Speaker 0: Okay, he's on ring road now.

2206
03:47:57,803 --> 03:47:58,612
Speaker 0: I've been asking.

2207
03:48:00,081 --> 03:48:01,954
Speaker 0: Dude, who is this freaking?

2208
03:48:01,974 --> 03:48:02,135
Speaker 0: 4-2-5?

2209
03:48:02,276 --> 03:48:02,920
Speaker 0: who's answering up?

2210
03:48:03,041 --> 03:48:04,620
Speaker 0: He said the Harry wagon's coming.

2211
03:48:04,760 --> 03:48:06,640
Speaker 0: Well, that's even better because now we can get them all over there.

2212
03:48:16,985 --> 03:48:17,559
Speaker 0: They're up there.

2213
03:48:18,922 --> 03:48:22,880
Speaker 0: The Nemlech guy, the dog bit this guy, I guess, on the leg.

2214
03:48:23,200 --> 03:48:24,759
Speaker 0: No, no, up the back there.

2215
03:48:24,880 --> 03:48:25,338
Speaker 0: Oh, he's up there.

2216
03:48:31,507 --> 03:48:37,841
Speaker 0: How's it all, 81?

2217
03:48:37,841 --> 03:48:40,578
Speaker 0: Stand by to take the car to security.

2218
03:48:44,690 --> 03:48:45,326
Speaker 0: 20-0, Adler.

2219
03:48:47,901 --> 03:48:52,020
Speaker 0: I'm at the one at 285 Columbus, right at Columbus and Clarendon.

2220
03:48:53,341 --> 03:48:56,720
Speaker 0: Columbus and Clarendon, car to stand by until we get that secured.

2221
03:49:14,543 --> 03:49:16,420
Speaker 0: Got away from us, but he still got caught.

2222
03:49:32,501 --> 03:49:37,820
Speaker 0: You guys going to transport them?

2223
03:49:38,681 --> 03:49:39,398
Speaker 0: Where'd they go?

2224
03:49:39,922 --> 03:49:40,480
Speaker 0: Oh, they're over there.

2225
03:49:42,145 --> 03:49:43,740
Speaker 0: Probably like Tufts or something.

03:49:53,170 --> 03:49:54,140
Speaker 0: You guys going to transport?

2227
03:49:56,893 --> 03:49:57,260
Speaker 0: Where at?

2228
03:50:04,813 --> 03:50:05,079
Speaker 0: Tufts?

2229
03:50:05,340 --> 03:50:05,526
Speaker 0: Alright.

2230
03:50:11,501 --> 03:50:13,940
Speaker 0: He said they're going to... Sorry, what?

2231
03:50:15,723 --> 03:50:16,039
Speaker 0: Okay.

2232
03:50:17,304 --> 03:50:18,119
Speaker 0: They're going to Tufts.

2233
03:50:18,945 --> 03:50:19,072
Speaker 0: Tufts.

2234
03:50:19,543 --> 03:50:19,767
Speaker 0: Tufts?

2235
03:50:19,828 --> 03:50:22,360
Speaker 0: Okay, I'll send... We grab all your info.

2236
03:50:22,860 --> 03:50:24,700
Speaker 0: Alright, do you know where the state police prisoners are?

2237
03:50:24,763 --> 03:50:25,078
Speaker 0: Are those males?

2238
03:50:27,343 --> 03:50:27,871
Speaker 0: Yes, one.

2239
03:50:28,156 --> 03:50:28,420
Speaker 0: One male.

2240
03:50:29,365 --> 03:50:29,752
Speaker 0: One male.

2241
03:50:29,772 --> 03:50:30,199
Speaker 0: Okay, stand by.

2242
03:50:39,583 --> 03:50:41,200
Speaker 0: They're saying to bring them over to Dave Boulevard.

2243
03:50:42,182 --> 03:50:43,820
Speaker 0: He's still got cuffs on, Brian.

2244
03:50:45,862 --> 03:50:47,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're going to have to summons him.

2245
03:50:48,081 --> 03:50:49,218
Speaker 0: Get him transported.

2246
03:50:49,722 --> 03:50:50,659
Speaker 0: You want me to take him off?

2247
03:50:51,224 --> 03:50:51,334
Speaker 0: Yeah.

2248
03:50:57,862 --> 03:51:00,660
Speaker 0: Hey, we're not going to guide him, so he's not in custody.

2249
03:51:01,362 --> 03:51:02,460
Speaker 0: I'll grab the cuffs off.

2250
03:51:02,460 --> 03:51:04,040
Speaker 0: I was going to say, he's wearing somebody's cuffs.

2251
03:51:07,582 --> 03:51:09,220
Speaker 0: You're going to get summonsed to court, okay?

2252
03:51:10,840 --> 03:51:13,379
Speaker 0: Because we don't have enough people to watch you at the hospital.

2253
03:51:15,286 --> 03:51:15,939
Speaker 0: Can you lean forward?

2254
03:51:16,280 --> 03:51:17,720
Speaker 0: I'm going to take the cuffs off you.

2255
03:51:21,861 --> 03:51:22,880
Speaker 0: A little more, if you can.

2256
03:51:23,060 --> 03:51:25,459
Speaker 0: Let me see if they've got enough room down in the barracks for all five of them.

2257
03:51:34,492 --> 03:51:35,589
Speaker 0: Sorry if I'm pinching you.

2258
03:51:35,851 --> 03:51:36,348
Speaker 0: There it goes.

2259
03:51:44,491 --> 03:51:46,630
Speaker 0: Correct me if I'm wrong, boss, there's a size one.

2260
03:51:56,247 --> 03:51:56,580
Speaker 0: We're good.

2261
03:51:59,505 --> 03:52:00,180
Speaker 0: You got him off, yeah?

2262
03:52:00,261 --> 03:52:00,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got him off.

2263
03:52:02,180 --> 03:52:02,351
Speaker 0: Alright.

2264
03:52:06,453 --> 03:52:07,299
Speaker 0: You want to take me too?

2265
03:52:08,560 --> 03:52:08,624
Speaker 0: Why?

2266
03:52:09,764 --> 03:52:10,379
Speaker 0: I'm suicidal.

2267
03:52:10,963 --> 03:52:11,457
Speaker 0: Don't say that.

2268
03:52:13,201 --> 03:52:14,340
Speaker 0: Hey, is he just going to be a summoner?

2269
03:52:14,607 --> 03:52:14,779
Speaker 0: Yeah.

2270
03:52:15,586 --> 03:52:16,300
Speaker 0: We can't guide him.

2271
03:52:16,541 --> 03:52:17,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, no problem.

2272
03:52:17,501 --> 03:52:17,939
Speaker 0: I'm good with that.

2273
03:52:19,109 --> 03:52:19,379
Speaker 0: Thank you.

2274
03:52:27,670 --> 03:52:28,254
Speaker 0: Ask him.

2275
03:52:28,355 --> 03:52:30,450
Speaker 0: if he can take one more dog bite, then he's free to go.

2276
03:52:30,721 --> 03:52:30,762
Speaker 0: Ha!

2277
03:52:35,594 --> 03:52:39,049
Speaker 0: I think you can just go left on Boylston, the wrong way.

2278
03:52:39,690 --> 03:52:42,210
Speaker 0: Alright, they have one CC punched for four so far.

2279
03:52:42,453 --> 03:52:42,989
Speaker 0: Do you need another one?

2280
03:52:46,615 --> 03:52:50,990
Speaker 0: Okay, 202.

2281
03:52:50,990 --> 03:52:51,309

Speaker 0: You need a number?

2286
03:53:13,972 --> 03:53:15,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, why don't you have Almeda?

2287
03:53:15,221 --> 03:53:19,130
Speaker 0: grab all his info and... Yeah, and we'll just have him right here.

Speaker 0: He's behind the plate now, so... He's behind it now.

2290
03:53:23,191 --> 03:53:23,490
Speaker 0: Then what?

2291

Speaker 0: Nope, he's on it.

2292
03:53:30,655 --> 03:53:30,948

Speaker 0: Another two lines, yeah.

2323
03:54:47,011 --> 03:54:50,386
Speaker 0: Also a suspect fucking stopped by a canine and officer.

2324
03:54:51,190 --> 03:54:52,387
Speaker 0: With four canines around him.

2325
03:54:52,890 --> 03:54:53,362
Speaker 0: Fucking moron.

2326
03:54:53,730 --> 03:54:54,228
Speaker 0: He was still running.

2327
03:54:55,253 --> 03:54:57,250
Speaker 0: We walked up like 11 people in there.

2328
03:54:57,754 --> 03:54:57,947
Speaker 0: I know.

2329
03:54:58,271 --> 03:54:59,084
Speaker 0: Well, we held it.

2330
03:54:59,770 --> 03:54:59,870
Speaker 0: Yeah.

2331
03:55:00,611 --> 03:55:02,670
Speaker 0: We were chasing them around there.

2332
03:55:03,013 --> 03:55:03,830
Speaker 0: It was wild.

2333
03:55:03,911 --> 03:55:05,350
Speaker 0: I get five arrests for the state.

2334
03:55:06,071 --> 03:55:07,090
Speaker 0: They're all state prisoners.

2335
03:55:07,290 --> 03:55:09,750
Speaker 0: Three go to State Boulevard and two go to Massport Hall Road.

2336
03:55:09,911 --> 03:55:11,290
Speaker 0: I didn't have to do a thing besides cuff them.

2337
03:55:12,611 --> 03:55:12,906
Speaker 0: Okay.

2338
03:55:13,651 --> 03:55:15,870
Speaker 0: I think it's only one of them going to be going to the state.

2339
03:55:16,433 --> 03:55:18,010
Speaker 0: I guess Boston's going to take the fall off.

2340
03:55:19,035 --> 03:55:20,170
Speaker 0: I had two sets of cuffs.

2341
03:55:21,012 --> 03:55:22,170
Speaker 0: Trooper gave me another one.

2342
03:55:22,453 --> 03:55:23,168
Speaker 0: I ran out of everything.

2343
03:55:23,550 --> 03:55:24,130
Speaker 0: Do you need them now?

2344
03:55:25,308 --> 03:55:25,350
Speaker 0: No.

2345
03:55:25,719 --> 03:55:25,909
Speaker 0: Fuck.

2346
03:55:26,838 --> 03:55:27,070
Speaker 0: Done.

2347
03:55:27,970 --> 03:55:29,686
Speaker 0: I'm a chief, so I typically don't cuff people.

2348
03:55:31,241 --> 03:55:31,710
Speaker 0: If you need them.

2349
03:55:32,131 --> 03:55:33,210
Speaker 0: No, I'll be fine.

2350
03:55:34,274 --> 03:55:35,969
Speaker 0: I think he's going to cut us loose anyway.

2351
03:55:43,355 --> 03:55:44,010
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe.

2352
03:55:44,311 --> 03:55:45,429
Speaker 0: If you're sure you don't need them.

2353
03:55:48,374 --> 03:55:49,609
Speaker 0: God knows what we're going to run into.

2354
03:55:50,172 --> 03:55:50,650
Speaker 0: Thanks, chief.

2355
03:55:53,119 --> 03:55:53,549
Speaker 0: Thank you.

2356
03:56:07,885 --> 03:56:08,210
Speaker 0: P.J.

2357
03:56:08,250 --> 03:56:08,758
Speaker 0: Kearney, go up.

2358
03:56:11,384 --> 03:56:11,680
Speaker 0: Go up.

03:56:29,004 --> 03:56:30,200
Speaker 0: Kilo 104 on the assignment.

03:56:49,031 --> 03:56:49,073
Speaker 0: Me.

2361
03:56:51,531 --> 03:56:52,873
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, no, that's good.

2362
03:56:58,224 --> 03:56:58,597
Speaker 0: I got four.

2363
03:57:00,541 --> 03:57:03,271
Speaker 0: I'm on the corner and this kid comes flying out the door.

2364
03:57:20,142 --> 03:57:20,980
Speaker 0: That's unbelievable.

2365
03:57:23,502 --> 03:57:26,019
Speaker 0: There's fucking, Newberry Street, there's eight of us.

2366
03:57:26,605 --> 03:57:27,017
Speaker 0: Eight of us.

2367
03:57:27,500 --> 03:57:29,999
Speaker 0: And they're fucking, they're breaking into every fucking building.

2368
03:57:31,000 --> 03:57:34,520
Speaker 0: They've burned, they've smashed his car right in front of us.

2369
03:57:34,520 --> 03:57:35,188
Speaker 0: Drive here.

2370
03:57:38,766 --> 03:57:39,560
Speaker 0: Just give me a minute.

2371
03:57:39,722 --> 03:57:40,160
Speaker 0: What did you guys say?

2372
03:57:41,122 --> 03:57:42,399
Speaker 0: He's tried running around.

2373
03:57:43,962 --> 03:57:45,479
Speaker 0: Doesn't, even if, let's say we hit him.

2374
03:57:46,820 --> 03:57:48,117
Speaker 0: So if I can walk, at least he's right here.

2375
03:57:48,740 --> 03:57:49,560
Speaker 0: He could jump in.

2376
03:57:58,001 --> 03:57:58,293
Speaker 0: That's him.

2377
03:58:00,101 --> 03:58:00,513
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2378
03:58:07,141 --> 03:58:10,759
Speaker 0: His, uh, his cousin that came up was afraid of him.

2379
03:58:14,763 --> 03:58:16,015
Speaker 0: So, you're good to help him.

2380
03:58:16,924 --> 03:58:17,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, how?

2381
03:58:18,606 --> 03:58:19,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll find him.

2382
03:58:19,902 --> 03:58:23,599
Speaker 0: We gotta go find, see if our, our bags are in the van.

2383
03:58:24,442 --> 03:58:25,400
Speaker 0: They looted it, though.

2384
03:58:29,843 --> 03:58:31,099
Speaker 0: I don't even know what's in it.

2385
03:58:31,321 --> 03:58:32,156
Speaker 0: I don't think it was that bad.

2386
03:58:35,721 --> 03:58:39,160
Speaker 0: You know, I'm never gonna get a replacement from this goddamn joke of a department.

2387
03:58:41,781 --> 03:58:42,980
Speaker 0: Sarge, I'm sorry, what was your name again?

2388
03:58:43,220 --> 03:58:43,516
Speaker 0: McRael.

2389
03:58:43,840 --> 03:58:44,222
Speaker 0: M-C-G-R-A-E-L.

2390
03:58:47,780 --> 03:58:49,079
Speaker 0: So if you're clear, I'll take both bags.

2391
03:58:51,126 --> 03:58:51,680
Speaker 0: I'll make sure.

2392
03:58:53,480 --> 03:58:54,380
Speaker 0: Delta 903?

2393
03:58:54,380 --> 03:58:54,480
Speaker 0: Yeah.

2394
03:58:55,402 --> 03:58:56,200
Speaker 0: Are we going right now?

2395
03:58:57,403 --> 03:58:58,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll get you guys out of here.

2396
03:58:59,121 --> 03:58:59,185
Speaker 0: Yes.

2397
03:59:00,502 --> 03:59:01,940
Speaker 0: Sarge, is he gonna be securing for the night?

2398
03:59:02,506 --> 03:59:03,019
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, let's go.

2399
03:59:04,482 --> 03:59:06,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a Gray and a Russell report.

2400
03:59:06,420 --> 03:59:06,551
Speaker 0: Sure.

2401
03:59:06,881 --> 03:59:08,000
Speaker 0: For five of these turns.

2402
03:59:08,220 --> 03:59:08,739
Speaker 0: Thank you, guys.

2403
03:59:09,326 --> 03:59:09,518
Speaker 0: All right.

03:59:11,552 --> 03:59:11,600
Speaker 0: Ha!

03:59:12,024 --> 03:59:12,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, right?

2406
03:59:22,360 --> 03:59:23,880
Speaker 0: Well, it was a pleasure, gentlemen.

2407
03:59:24,080 --> 03:59:25,360
Speaker 0: Good job, boys, let's do this again, huh?

2408
03:59:25,960 --> 03:59:27,340
Speaker 0: Fuckin' won't be a night to forget.

2409
03:59:28,060 --> 03:59:28,288
Speaker 0: We'll do it.

2410
03:59:28,700 --> 03:59:29,014
Speaker 0: Well done.

2411
03:59:29,665 --> 03:59:30,320
Speaker 0: Good job.

2412
03:59:30,864 --> 03:59:31,339
Speaker 0: Thanks, guys.

03:59:31,504 --> 03:59:32,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, two's there.

2414
03:59:32,422 --> 03:59:32,860
Speaker 0: Two's there.

2415
03:59:32,980 --> 03:59:33,818
Speaker 0: I think the seven's another one.

2416
03:59:34,140 --> 03:59:34,318
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

2417
03:59:34,760 --> 03:59:36,820
Speaker 0: When they see the media covering this, yeah.

2418
03:59:37,080 --> 03:59:38,799
Speaker 0: And the media will paint it as a peaceful protest.

2419
03:59:39,880 --> 03:59:40,520
Speaker 0: Completely overreacting.

2420
03:59:41,203 --> 03:59:41,960
Speaker 0: Without a doubt, they'll do it.

2421
03:59:49,542 --> 03:59:51,960
Speaker 0: Should I leave this thing on until we fuckin' get out of here?

2422
03:59:52,080 --> 03:59:53,420
Speaker 0: 'Cause you never know what's gonna happen.
